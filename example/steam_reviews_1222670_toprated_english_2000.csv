76561199229759681,tjlemke99,"While I love the sims, and this entry certainly runs smoother and looks better, with better character customization, that's where the good things about this game stop. It still costs hundreds of dollars to buy all the DLC for this game, and let me tell you that they've made everything into a DLC. Want a pet? DLC. Want to take your Sims out to a restaurant sometimes during the week like a normal person would do? DLC. Want to pretty much do anything with your Sims besides have them sit at home or wait for them to come back from working a job? DLC. It's after you play for a while and decide you want to start doing things, that  you realize you actually can't do sh** until you buy some DLC. This game has been out for years and there still isn't a bundle with all the DLC. I'm not going to buy a single pack, EA, you damn buffoons. I would have been happy to spend up to like $100 total on this game, but now I will stick with the free version and not spend a dime on the stupidly overpriced DLC. I would rather download all the DLC illegally than pay you hundreds for it. Honestly, I'd recommend you just play Sims 3, because there is a ton of included content compared to this game.",649,18,-1,"November 26, 2023"

milesware,Elonian Musket,"There should be a competing title in this genre so that EA won't keep cashing in on this community which has been more and more lenient and tried its best to put up with whatever bs dlc the devs have put together. It's a shame that this franchise has fallen so far. Pros: -Bunch of really nice quality of life features compared to the previous titles Con: -The game feels soulless and cutting corners at every possible opportunity to do so. -DLC price tag unjustified unlike the previous titles -Terrible and baffling game design decisions everywhere, they're some of the most cored features too -Action queue is extremely buggy years after the game's release, the amount of time for a sim to perform action/idling is nonsensical. -Removed sandbox design and put in the older scene/lot system is such a backwards compromise that's almost certainly done for technical/engine limits reason, such a shame to see so much game design potential being thrown into the trash because they chose the easy way out.(As expected, the decision here came back to bite them when they design some of the dlc content, which feels really disrupted by the constant fast travelling",728,8,-1,"July 7, 2020"

76561198168802858,TheTofuKiller,"TLDR: DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4!! Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets), and MOD THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• OUT OF IT!! Base Sims 4 is nearly unplayable due to the lack of content, repetitive and easily manipulative emotions system, and an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds? Why do they take so long to eat? Why are the lots so small and so empty? Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3, and heck, even Sims 2 brought over?? (Horses, Cars, pools, restaurants, grocery stores, fun recreational activities, ect.) With that being said, there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this game, if you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Mods, because they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thing, then I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi** Mod Recommendations (Like seriously, don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods) Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam (Not necessary, but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendly, will do 100% of the work for you) Meaningful Stories by roBurky (A mod pack that effectively revamps the mood and emotions systems of Sims 4. This makes the systems feel waaay more fleshed out and realistic, and significantly less manipulatable) Better Romance by simler90 (Adds more rules and checks into how Sims romance one another. In base Sims 4, you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon it, making it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.) Wonderful Whims by TURBODRIVER (Goes great with Better Romance with no compatibility issues that I'm aware of. Adds in an Attractiveness system, first Impressions, Personality Archetypes, and even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With this, you are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewarding, and designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.) There is also a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• load of CC (Custom Content) out there like clothes, hair, buildings, Sims, ect. ""Mod The Sims"" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packs, because most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online. Usually looks nicer too.",442,6,1,"July 1, 2021"

ouenji,ouenji,"Before this review, I feel like it's important to say that I have more than 23.7 hours in this game. A LOT more. I've got that much alone on PS4, and 500+ hours on my original origin account, which I can sadly no longer access to check the exact number. I got this game 9 years ago, full price retail, and have played it on and off since the age of 9. I've played this game to death over the years, and that's why it hurts me to leave a negative review. You can still have fun with it, and I will explain that, but it's flaws are just too plentiful for me to leave a positive review. It would be easy to say that this game used to be great, but that... would be a blatant lie. The game was barren when it released. Key features from past games were missing, like toddlers and POOLS. How were we supposed to kill our sims now? Give them a long and happy life until a natural death? Hardly! Along with that, the map screens didn't even have colour; they were pure white, sterile places. Maybe it was supposed to be stylistic, but... I can't help but think about how much cheaper it must have been. Slowly, over the years, we started to get more DLC packs of various tiers. It didn't start out too egregious, I wouldn't say. Sure, Luxury Party Stuff was lacklustre, but we had things like Outdoor Retreat to keep us going! Though, it was hard not to note how quickly EA had jumped to make DLC whilst the core game was missing such basic features. That isn't even to say how the community at large took the closed-world and lack of colour and pattern customisation. I'll tell you how they took it; badly. They took it badly. With all this DLC, there was a problem. IT. DIDN'T. STOP. Now, it's normal for a Sims game to have a large amount of DLC. But this? It became staggering. As of this review, all of the DLC for this game will run you over $800. OVER. EIGHT. HUNDRED. DOLLARS. I'll let that sink in. Have you ever wondered how this game is free? That's how. It's not like this DLC is truly optional. Some of it is, sure! But would you like your life simulator to have weather? A normal amount of clothes? More than THREE PLACES TO LIVE, ONE OF THEM BEING AN EMPTY FIELD? Then you'd best pony up! It's hard to fully express how empty this game feels without DLC. And EA knows it feels that empty, and that they can keep milking us for every last cent. At this point, you may have noticed something, or you may have not. And that's the fact that I said I've been playing this game for nine years. And that means the game has been out for nine years now. Since 2014. This game is almost a decade old. This is an issue. A big issue. When this game first released, it prided itself on it's intelligent autonomous sims. They can multitask; like watching television AND eating at the same time! Wowzers! But with this much time having passed, you'd be hard pressed to find somebody confident to call these sims anything above 'serviceable, I guess'. Your sims will wash their plates in the bathroom! Your sims will grab water if you leave them alone for two seconds and drink until they experience bladder failure! Your sims will start a fight with their spouse, seemingly just for kicks! Your sims will stop moving until you reset them with a cheat code! Your sims will be left with an undeletable action in their queue until you, again, use a cheat code! You get the picture. This game is a mess, with problems that could be wiped clean in a theoretical Sims 5. So why don't they? Because EA have created a live-service single-player game, and they'd be stupid to give it up. This live-service model, piling DLC upon DLC onto the game? It's managed to cause even more issues than the game had to begin with. Each new download comes with new bugs unique in nature. Oops, there go your textures! Oops, your sims are now all autonomously screaming at each other! Oops, your Sims are BUILDING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN! These are the kinds of things you'll have to get used to, and this only gets worse each time they add DLC. There are problems in this game that have become support beams by this point; fix those bugs, and everything will fall apart. So they just... don't! The Sims 4 is fundamentally broken, and they won't throw the game out and start fresh, because the horse they're beating still isn't dead. Just bleeding and shambling. This greed helped lead to the point we've reached today. Even with the uproar against My First Pet Stuff (A DLC for a DLC), it seemed enough people were content to buy such a tiny stuff pack because we got a whole new category for things just like it. Kits. Dear lord, kits. These things aren't popular with the community, and it's clear to see why. Such meagre amounts of items might seem doable at $5 a pop, but they're adding up, and quick. Filled with lacklustre designs that only work well as a base for custom content, they're the peak of EA's lazy contributions to this game. I mentioned custom content, so I suppose that's a horse out the stable now. Yeah, custom content is amazing. And that's because EA has no hand in it. Well, I should give them a little credit; the native mod support is an honestly nice touch! There's your first positive, EA. Custom content is a general term for items created by the community. Clothes, furniture, accessories, you name it! With multiple dedicated sites to download it, and fan made tools that make creation easy, it's great! And by easy, I mean easy. I was making Pokemon shirts for my games at age 12. Just takes a little research. All these items come in two main styles; one more realistic (Alpha) and one to match the game's items (Maxis Match). Build up a good folder filled with gigabytes of fashion and get to work living your life in Create-A-Sim; don't forgot to buy a new SD card to fit it all in. You'll need it. It's not just custom content that the community makes. There's also good old fashioned script mods. These have all sorts of functions; they can fix some in-game issues, add entirely new game mechanics, give you features that you always wanted (controllable pets comes to mind), and more. (More including the... infamous Wicked Whims and Extreme Violence mods. Ah, timeless classics). All these mods help breathe new life into the game and show how passionate this community can be, no matter how downtrodden by the source material. These mods help to show how this game is actually fun at it's core. You might have read all this ragging and be baffled by my heel-turn, but it's true. Why else would I have put in all those hours? That core gameplay loop of letting your sims lead their lives is damn fun, and I can't help but enjoy it; even with everything EA is doing. I think that others could enjoy it too if they started playing today. There is something here, at the heart of it. It's just coated in a decade of bloat and greed. (This segment is a replacement for an old one that caused me issues, that I'm removing to keep this review safe. I think you can tell by the comments below and the tone of this review what that was, and you can take that as you wish.) Anyway, EA can do one, and you should give Sims 4 a chance, if you like. There's good here, but this game reeks of greed and jank at it's core.",416,16,-1,"January 23, 2023"

I understand maybe buying a pass for x of dlc but the fact you have to pay for each one is an actual joke. making them spend ¬£18 plus to be a werewolf, Vampire or to just have a Pet. They even charge for seasons like snow etc. It's EA so makes sense, This game is the literal embodiment of slicing up the game and selling the pieces back to consumers.  Or a 1000 piece jigsaw but charging you after 10 pieces have been put together. They don't even give loyal or franchise veterans anything for free. If you're rich or don't intend on buying loads of DLC maybe buy this game. Fans should take a stand and boycott the franchise to stop their greed until they remove this awful scheme of extracting money from fans.

elzatraz,Elzatraz,"This is my favorite game that I can't recommend. I love this game, as my playtime will tell, and I will continue to pour more hours into this game. I'm not giving a negative review because of the game's ""fun factor."" It's very destressing, it's chill, its difficulty is all in the hands of the players. The modding scene is great, and the creative possibilities are infinite. On paper, the Sims 4 seems like the dream game. A perfect game that even people who have literally never touched a game before in their life can pick up and play. In reality, EA has erected a massive series of walls that you have to scale to reach that state, and this is the crux of the review. The ultimate problem is, and is the whole reason I'm giving this a negative review, is recommending people to buy this game because of the aforementioned walls. To say that they have become untenable is an understatement. They are nigh insurmountable at this point. The first wall, and this is the point where most people stop at, is the pricing. It being free-to-play as of October 18th does not save this from being HORRIDLY expensive through DLC cost. The base Sims 4 with no expansions or packs, makes the game EXTREMELY limited in scope as to what you can do. Want to be a spellcaster? Want to attend university? Have cats or dogs?  Have changing seasons in the weather? Form clubs? Get famous? Have a job? That's ALL locked behind DLC that is either the same price as the base game, or, get this, DOUBLE the price of the base game. All those things I listed? Those are SEPARATE DLCs! If you were to not get them on sale, it would run you a couple HUNDRED already! And this just getting started. On the store page, as I'm typing this right now, it lists 56 different DLC, and to buy them all in one fell swoop costs just short of a THOUSAND  dollars. Nobody in their right mind should make that investment, and I can't be of the mind to tell someone to spend that much on a single game. Now, to play Devil's Advocate for a moment, this is only as bad if you buy it when it isn't on sale, which the game goes on quite frequently. Deep sales, in fact! Up to 75% a lot of things, which bring down the price for everything by a couple hundred dollars. In fact, with the Summer Sale that's coming up as of the time of writing this review, this game will most likely get significant price slashes. However, to counter that point, the asking price is still SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. The prices become more manageable, but it is still a SIGNIFICANT investment. More of an investment than, frankly, I think this game deserves. And considering how Sims 3 with everything still costs such an outrageous amount, it would seem that those prices aren't going anywhere for the time being. If a high asking price was all that kept people away, I suppose you could argue the point that not recommending a game you like because of pricing is silly. That if you put hundreds of hours in like I have, the price is ""worth it."" Perhaps that argument would have grounds and I would entertain it, if not for the fact that the game in of itself just fundamentally DOES NOT WORK with everything combined. These are the other walls, and this can become overwhelming for the inexperienced. Even if you buy everything and you jump in, the Sims 4 is a strange program that seemingly randomly decides to brick itself every so often, without you even really being the cause of it. There are so many bugs and glitches that have no fixes for it, merely ways to temporarily relieve of you of it, much like ibuprofen for a headache. And they aren't the silly, funny glitches  seen in Skyrim. For example, randomly, the game will begin to run under 30 frames after exiting build mode, and you solve it by merely pausing the game and unpausing it. Not a terrible bug but it's pretty much the epitome of the problems I have with this game: everything is just player made solutions rather than an official bug fix. It will happen again, and instead of just fixing it, EA just tells you what you can do to help yourself with it. You'll be doing this often, spending hours looking up some obscure error, through no fault of your own, because either Sims 4 randomly decides to brick your Resources.cfg after update and makes it impossible for you to play with CC of any kinds, or your anti virus somehow marks this entire game as potential ransomware, or the Sims 4 randomly just corrupt your save file and you're trying to figure out how to fix that. And that's just on the meta side of everything. File headaches aside, the game itself just acts wonky as well, adding its own walls to scale. A cursory glance at the reviews for the DLCs illustrate the absolute nightmares that spawn with these additions, but I'll share some of the errors I've had on my end. I've had multiple instances where I tell a Sim to fulfill their hygiene need and their immediate first instinct is to...run out and clean a solar panel? In place of just taking a shower in one of the MULTIPLE showers that exist in that house? I tell them to fulfill their energy need, thinking they'll go to bed, and they'll either randomly decide to back float in the pool, or drink an incredibly irresponsible amount of coffee, like a third shift worker going off of only three hours of sleep.  Fixed all of this by manually telling them what to do. I've also had moments where I couldn't wash laundry because the game bugged out my washer and dryer, where the prompts for washing never came up. Only the prompts for putting the dirty laundry in and taking the dirty laundry out. Fixed by selling the set and then buying another. I've also had my weather permanently glitch itself into never changing at all. Where it snows all through winter and all through spring, causing me to have to buy a weather changing device in game and use it. Sims will randomly drop whatever they are doing to do some unrelated task, such as stop cooking to randomly mold some hunk of clay sitting in some corner of the room. Sometimes, my Sims will also stand still with the ""chat with (sim)"" action in the queue, but then never actually chat with that person,, for whatever reason, causing them to bug ouit and need them to be reset. The list goes on and on, and I think you've gotten the point already. Again, these are fixed by just manually selecting actions, using console commands, and removing the bugged items in question. I know what you're thinking. Why are you complaining about bugs that have an in game solution? The issue is, again, that this is just player solutions for problems that aren't being fixed. You're paying hundreds of dollars for this game and the DLC. You'd expect a level of polish to behind this, but there isn't. Players shouldn't have to actively fight against a game they bought, only to find a bunch of band-aid, player made solutions a because the FEATURES IN GAME THEY PAID HUNDREDS FOR DOESN'T WORK AND EA DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM. It's all the same hackneyed excuse of ""there being so much in this game"" and sounding like they are some small game dev studio. All of this frustration after the ludicrous pay wall is just simply unforgivable, and to recommend people this game knowing the hours worth of troubleshooting and fixing I've had to do is like to encourage self destructive tendencies. I made the investment, I bought the steam edition to make a review. I sunk a lot both in time and money, and have got to a point where I can say I enjoy this game, perhaps through Sunken Cost reasoning and Stockholm Syndrome. But it required me having to scale multiple walls and slaying multiple beasts to get there, and that's just simply not a journey for everyone. I cannot look at someone and genuinely tell them to make the same investments I have, nor do I think EA should benefit from having people do so.

It was my first Sims game, so I had no prior experience or expectations. And I did enjoy the game...at first. I started buying some DLC to have more stuff to do. I liked creating characters and watching them interact. But then I realized something. I spent a lot of time and money to play dollhouse. I listened to a community that had to wait several years to get basic features. Did you know this game first released without ghosts, pools, and toddlers? You know, staple parts of the series? Did you know it costs thousands of dollars to buy all the DLC to have all the content? Oh, and some of that content that used to be in the base game is now behind that paywall. And some of the DLC is basically buggy abandonware (like Dine Out and My Wedding Stories; don't get those packs unless you have mods to patch the bugs out). The newest expansions (which are $40) had a lot of bugs, glitches, and content issues (like in For Rent, you aren't being paid rent). Oh, and in a recent update you know get a pulsating ""shopping"" button on the in-game UI so you can buy more packs. That was the final straw. I have never seen a company act so disrespectful to its consumer base. This game is over a decade old, and it doesn't hold a candle to the older games. It actively pushes out as much advertisement as a mobile game full of microtransactions. EA and the devs are playing Weekend at Bernie's with this aged system and expecting the players to be grateful for subpar content. Just don't do it.

nmmdog,Nate,"Product refunded After coming from The Sims 3, I was severely disappointed. Setting aside all of the EAisms about the game (obscenely expensive expansions to get basic game play features that should be in the base game, over inclusion of social media aspects, etc.) I was expecting a phenomenal experience. Instead, they seem to have limited the ability to travel, removing the semi-open world of TS3 and instead reverting back to a very old school system of traveling to what basically amounts to a few city blocks, which was the most disappointing feature. You can no longer have your sims travel to work in a real environment, instead they do the ole disappearing act and reappear after 8 hours. No more travelling to a grocery store, all supplies are magically bought and created out of thin air. I felt like I was playing TS1 or 2 again, and everything feels very stripped down and bare-bones, very much like a mobile game. To be fair, they have added a much more in depth sim creator, which is pretty cool if that's all you care about. The AI system seems to work better too with interactions between sims being more fluid and natural. Overall, disappointed. Wouldn't recommend.",520,17,-1,"June 24, 2020"

It's over ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. Each DLC is an amusing twist on the game, adding fun elements. But is it worth that kind of cost?! Ffffff... Heck no. And without the DLC's, its just a matter of time until you get bored of watching your sims going through the same motions. Play long enough, and you get to see the neighbourhoods literally empty out because the AI algorithms/scripting they have in place doesn't handle their income, jobs etcetera, and having children. SO they all end up in immense debt, and don't have kids so when YOUR sims kids grow up, they're surrounded by a gradually depleting list of OAP's. Gee what a great game.

Have an iconic well known title,  make it only a small portion of the game and lock everything else, hanging the carrot in your face, with Expansion packs galore. Would I recommend you play this game? Yes. Absolutley, if you have the actual FULL game or just any level of added content besides the base game it Would i recommend you buy it? Maybe the base game on a steep sale.

ibbers,ibbers,"Find ""other"" means to get this game fully unlocked The game is good and enjoyable, however it can be both recommended and not. The Sims 4"" builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors, refining the gameplay mechanics and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game allows players to create and control virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences. Pros and cons üü© Positives üü• Negatives - Robust building mechanics and extensive customisation options allow for highly detailed, personalised environments and characters. - Open-ended approach to storytelling encourages player agency and immersion, fostering a sense of investment and attachment to the Sims and their lives. - Emotions system adds depth and complexity to Sims' behaviour and interactions, encouraging players to consider their Sims' psychological and emotional well-being. - User-generated content and modding community expand the game's creative possibilities and offer additional content and features. - Initial lack of content and features compared to previous iterations of the series may lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players. Reliance on DLC and microtransactions may restrict access to certain content and features for players unwilling or unable to make additional purchases. - The absence of certain features, such as curved walls or split-level structures, may limit the game's creative potential for some players. - Monetisation strategies and content-locking practices have raised concerns about the game's accessibility and value for money. Mechanics and Design The game retains the core gameplay mechanics of the series, allowing players to create and customise virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences. Emotions System Another significant addition is the Emotions system, which adds depth and complexity to the Sims' behaviour and interactions. Sims can now experience a wide range of emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and embarrassment, which are influenced by their environment, social interactions, and personal traits. Building A central aspect of the sim's franchise experience is the building mechanics, which allow players to design, construct, and customise their Sims' homes and community lots. One of the most notable improvements is introducing the room-based building system. This system allows players to create and manipulate individual rooms as modular units, making rearranging and modifying structures easier without requiring extensive reconstruction. This feature streamlines the building process and encourages experimentation. Thus, players can quickly test different layouts and configurations with minimal effort. Another significant enhancement is the addition of the Build Mode catalogue, which offers a vast array of objects, materials, and decorative items for players to choose from. The catalogue is organised into intuitive categories and features a search function, making it easier for players to find and select the necessary items. This extensive selection of building and furnishing options enables players to create highly detailed and personalised environments that reflect their Sims' personalities, lifestyles, and aspirations. Moreover, the game's vibrant modding community further enriches the building mechanics, which has produced a wealth of custom content, ranging from unique architectural elements to entire pre-built lots. This user-generated content expands the game's creative possibilities. It allows players to incorporate diverse styles and designs into their creations. However, the building mechanics in ""The Sims 4"" have limitations. Some players have expressed frustration with the lack of certain features, such as the ability to create curved walls or split-level structures, which were available in previous iterations of the series. Additionally, the game's reliance on DLC and microtransactions mean that access to certain building materials and objects may be restricted for players who do not wish to make additional purchases. DLCs: Locking and Monetisation Strategies In previous iterations of the series, certain features and content were included in the base game or expansion packs, providing players with a more comprehensive experience without additional purchases. However, ""The Sims 4"" has adopted a more aggressive monetisation strategy, with numerous expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs that collectively add to a significant financial investment for players wishing to access the full range of content. This has led to concerns about the game's reliance on downloadable content (DLC) and microtransactions, which can be seen as a barrier to entry for players with limited financial resources. This form of microtransactions has been criticised for several reasons. Firstly, it can be seen as a form of artificial content scarcity. Once part of the core experience, features and content are now gated behind additional purchases. This can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players, who may feel that they are being unfairly charged for content that should have been included in the base game. Secondly, this monetisation strategy raises concerns about the potential normalisation of microtransactions in the gaming industry, as it may encourage other developers and publishers to adopt similar practices. And I guarantee this practice will be the same if the Sims 5 ever comes out. This could shift towards a more fragmented and costly gaming landscape, where players are increasingly expected to pay for additional content to enjoy a complete and fulfilling experience. It is important to critically evaluate these monetisation strategies and consider their implications for the gaming industry and player experience. While developers and publishers have a legitimate need to generate revenue to sustain their operations and continue producing high-quality games, it is essential to balance financial viability and provide a fair, accessible, and enjoyable experience for players. By supporting more ethical and consumer-friendly monetisation practices, players can help to shape a more sustainable and equitable gaming landscape for all. Conclusion ""The Sims 4"" offers a unique and engaging virtual life simulation experience, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessors and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game's strengths lie in its emphasis on creativity, self-expression, and storytelling and its efforts to improve accessibility and inclusivity. However, I cannot recommend buying the game due to EA's monetisation strategy, but it is a ""fine"" game. However, if you ever want to go out to sea, you can easily find everything unlocked in that vast ocean.",254,12,1,"June 29, 2023"

quirky_kitty,Quirky_Kitty,"The Sims 4 is an expensive habit to keep if you are a person, like myself, who feels as if they absolutely must have every available DLC for a game which they enjoy. Without sales or bundling, as of writing this, the entirety of The Sims 4 will cost you a whopping $964.47. I can't say I am surprised, as this is an EA game, but that does not excuse the disgrace that price tag is. On the other side of that spectrum, people who do not want to purchase any additional content, will more than likely be left dissatisfied with the base game. If you have played any of The Sims 4 predecessors, you will immediately notice that there are aspects ""missing"" from the base game experience that have either not been developed or have been withheld for the purpose of selling expansions/gamepacks/kits. The more recently released packs have been borderline not play tested before release. If you check the credits for these packs you will notice a stark difference in the number of people developing these and the division of their roles compared to earlier packs. In the end, after a few patches, we do end up with something playable, but many bugs never get fixed. I do believe it is possible to be satisfied with the game through two routes. Either A. The Sims 4 is your introduction to the franchise so you are unable to compare this title to its predecessors. or B. You curate a healthy mix of additional content alongside CC and mods. Overall, I would give this game a 7/10 rating, only because of the healthy cc and mod community backing it. Without any additional content, base game only, my rating drops to a 5/10- absolutely mediocre. IN SUMMARY: too expensive for a complete experience, predecessors were better for gameplay (TS4 build/buy and character creation is superior imo), incredibly healthy modding community.",224,8,1,"March 10, 2022"
philautiathegreat,philautiathegreat,"I have a long history with the Sims franchise. I started playing The Sims 2 when I was a child because of my mother (and, back in the day, even my grandmother played it). I remember The Sims 3 coming out. I've loved these games ever since I can remember, and they have a very special place in my heart. Buying this game on Steam was kinda useless, seeing as I already owned it since its release in 2014 on Origin (frankly, I just wanted to see those hours pile up on Steam whenever I get into the cycle of Remember Game Exists > Play Game Obsessively For A Short Period > Forget Game Exists, and I felt a little guilty about my, uhm, less-than-legitimate maritime exploration, to put it in a cute little ~metaphor~, of all of the DLC content over the years). Now, would I recommend The Sims 4? Honestly, it depends. There are many different kinds of Simmers, and I don't think this is the most adequate for every single one of them. Lore-wise? Girl, put on an eyepatch and go explore the Sims 2. If you're expecting fleshed out, non-half-assed stories, this will disappoint. (And it has. Why did they do the Caliente sisters this dirty? Why? I just wanna know...) Building-wise? 100% MADE FOR YOU, BUY IT. I have never considered myself a builder, ever, but this game... Oh, man, it really boosts my self-esteem, not gonna lie. Whenever I make house I'm really proud of, I showcase it to every one. It's great! I think everyone can agree that this game has the best Build-and-Buy Mode that the Sims franchise has ever seen. CAS-wise? Hmmmm, this one is tricky. Creating Sims is so fun, it's true, but without Custom Content? It's a no-go for me, thank you very much. I've recently discovered that a lot of people find the Sims 3 sims ugly, and that was honestly a HUGE surprise to me, because although the sims in The Sims 4 are much more aesthetically pleasing than in any of the other games WITH CUSTOM CONTENT INCLUDED, if I have to create vanilla sims? Nope. They're just kinda weird-looking, in my opinion, and I'd much rather play The Sims 3 if I'm not gonna include custom content. Now, one thing that should go without saying is that EA IS VERY GREEDY. This isn't news to anyone, I know, but I'm just saying this to emphasize that if you're not planning on buying any DLC for this game you may as well just go on a lawless maritime exploration of it instead of purchasing it, because the base game itself is NOT IT. At all. It gets boring after a while. My strategy going forward is probably going to be: play game > forget it exists > remember it exists > get the cheapest pack I can > play game with its new features. The DLC is very expensive, though, and that is something to remember. The Sims 3, for example, is worth playing with just the base game installed, in my opinion, so if you don't like to get absolutely scammed into giving EA your money, maybe try that one? Just don't get the Katy Perry stuff pack if you do decide to buy DLC after all. It's not worth it, bestie. (So, yes, while I know I am scamming myself at this point by monetarily supporting this game, I decided to do it anyway! It was an impulse-buy. But I digress,) Overall, The Sims 4 has gotten a lot better since it started. It's had a few hiccups along the road, and that's without counting the Star Wars pack, because I refuse to acknowledge that it wasn't a random fever dream I had. But it has gotten better, and I'd say it's worth playing if you pick a few DLC that you think you'll enjoy, and some Custom Content to your liking! I'd also recommend some mods like MC Command Center or other story progression mods just to make the game more realistic and fun. The Sims 4 community is active as hell on places like The Sims Resource or even Twitter and Tumblr, so make the most of it for your modding and/or objects and clothing needs. If you're not going to be taking part in any of that, though, for some reason... I'd refrain from playing this game at all. The Sims 4 is like sliced bread. You probably don't enjoy sliced bread by itself, or eat it very often, do you? It's plain, basic, and boring! The community provides some extra ingredients. If you won't be making a sandwich, you might as well not buy the plain-ass bread.",154,12,1,"October 31, 2021"

76561198255596335,Rick Bishop,"I broke down during the summer sale and bought the base game and several of the extras. I've been playing The Sims since its first version. When S4 came out I thought it might just be a money pit and stuck with S3, despite the many bugs 3 had. S3 had an awful lot of content. I'm giving The Sims 4 a recommend, but barely. The first impression of it hasn't been as good as I'd hoped, and I'm still on the fence about cost/benefit. Here's a typical pro/con list after the first inning or so: Some Pros: - The graphics. By far the most beautiful of the Sims games and with a slightly better create-a-sim interface, although see Cons below. The in-game look is terrific, especially the lighting, and the different ""worlds,"" which are really just neighborhoods your sim visits, load faster than they did in 3. This is because each neighborhood is small. Instead of forty lots and properties in one place that have to be loaded, you have maybe 12 places to each neighborhood with more neighborhoods, and travel is fast. The energy in the game was very clearly channeled into making everything look great and to take you much faster to a place you want to visit. - The more sophisticated mood manager. There's a state-of-mind thing in the game beyond the basic needs. You can be inspired, happy, energized, focused, and the total package of moods has its own benefits. Neat idea. - Bigger, smoother group gatherings. Putting a group together in the Sims 3 was always an iffy, glitchy, chaotic affair. S4 has a much better party function, including the Get Together expansion that has clubs you can join. Dancing is hilarious. - Great expansion ideas, particularly having to do with environmental responsibility (but, there are too many expansions with too little content added to each one, so we're back to the money pit). - Lots have a vibe to them. You can choose mood characteristics for a lot just as you do for a sim, so a lot can boost a sim's progress in certain pursuits. - Cute little kids and pets (with an expansion) who show natural behaviors that are often funny and adorable. - A few convenient streamlining decisions. Your sim doesn't have to wash every dish in the house anymore, for instance, although it's weird to have god (you) just pick up a dirty plate and ghost it into the trash can in a game all about chores and self care. Pro/Con: - The new content has some fun little surprises that weren't in S3, but these are often pros with cons attached. The objects in the new version have some neat interactions, although some of them simply don't do what they advertise. Patchy the Scarecrow, for instance, hangs out and watches TV--creepy--more often than doing anything in the garden. If you don't want a pal from a slasher movie then you want to keep him locked out of the house. When you hire a ""professional gardener"" the expensive contract worker stops by, waters a few plants, skips five other things that could be done, then charges you and goes home. But the bird feeder is fun. - Too easy to botch a big decision. You need to be careful about how getting married works or it won't go as the interface implies with its vaguely-labeled choices. You might want to use YouTube or Twitch streams before you make any life-changing choices. I tend to micromanage my sims, so if you're fine to just watch the random behavior show and see what gets set on fire, then you'll like the autonomy on and the hold-my-beer nature of some of the commands. I'm saying ""pro"" and writing ""con"" here. That sums up the Sims 4. You get nothing without paying for it in some way. My hope is that in time I'll just memorize which moments of programming stupidity I can get around. Cons: Some of these are pretty big. Gameplay in S3 was slow because of bugs. Gameplay in S4 is slow because your sims are simply dumber than bags of hammers. -  I don't know who decided that you can play the bejezus out of a piano but cannot for the life of you feed your toddler on less than four tries and two hours of wasted time, but the most basic element of The Sims since its invention has gotten a little lost--time management. You can't just pick up your toddler and walk downstairs with the kid. Oh, no. Takes hours unless you pick her up, indicate where you want to put her down, do that, then pick her up again to place her in the high chair, which may or may not happen, before you give her a bowl of generic food, which may be too confusing for your adult sim who understands music theory to accomplish in less than an hour. The kid in the game will likely be more patient with this than you are before she disintegrates into sadness and fills her pants because her other needs depleted while you were hammering away at meeting just the one. A shower in this game can take all day. Sims stand in place or just do something else when you give them commands--that's with autonomy shut off. With it on they'll simply ignore what you want them to do. They collapse into instant mood meltdown because of a thunderstorm. - There are tons of options for conversation, for things to buy, for things to do. And you will not be allowed to do them. Fascists designed this game. You have to reach level 10 of some profession to get an item. You have to be a comedian in order to become a musician. You have to figure out some puzzle sequence of interactions in order to achieve something that should be simple. If you like to cook and let your sims eat what they cook, they will be fat. You have to work out like the entire cast of Guardians of the Galaxy, including Rocket, in order to just keep the basic shape your sim had in create-a-sim for long stretches of that sim's life. Your wardrobe is still limited by function rather than just listing all the clothing and letting your sim wear what you want the sim to wear (without using cheats). The controlling nature of the design does not make the game ""more challenging"" unless you consider standing in a bread line with your government-issued ticket a fun challenge. You have to find your fun in a more zen way, just watching the neat stuff the game actually lets you do when the programming doesn't get in your way. - You might like a game that works best only when you use certain cheats. I like a game that's programmed so you aren't constantly tempted to revert to cheats. - You can't decide how long you want your sims to live. S3 had specific numbers of days you could set for stages of life. S4 just gives you ""short"" or ""long,"" and you have to squeeze in what is sometimes an unreachable goal into a life. S3 did some of this, too--the architect career track, for instance. Sadly, S4 didn't solve some time management problems from S3 in a time management game. I have read that you will likely never reach the top level of running a veterinary clinic before your sim dies, no matter how workaholic your sim is. - S4 got rid of vehicles, which seems like another way to undercut The Sims rather than make it more... simmish. When you want to go to another neighborhood you just fade out and show up in some cloud of transcendental teleportation. There's a space ship. There isn't a junker for you to drive to work while you save up for the cool sportscar. Strange, and not cool. - The price tag. It's hard to say you'll be getting what you want specifically from this game for less than $75 beyond the base game, even at the sale prices. Wait for the packs to go to at most $7.99 and wait for the game to age a little more so that the $40 expansions cost $25 or so. - Origin. Does anyone like Origin? Is that possible? Origin is the capitalist goon element that EA never needed and that turns every experience into navigating a giant mall to find a restroom. When I load a game I want to play the game, not open the door to another Jehovah's Witness offering me another pamphlet. I paid my money, Origin. Get out of my interface.",216,24,1,"July 2, 2020"

76561198284894042,Preston Gravy,"The TS4 base game is free. You may look at it and figure that for a free game, surely it can't be that bad. But once you start playing, you will immediately begin to notice the cracks. Unlike previous Sims games, TS4 lacks depth and engaging gameplay, making the base game feel like an unfinished demo. Travelling anywhere requires loading screens, relationships are shallow, and the sim AI is frustrating and annoying. There is so little to do in this game. And naturally, you are going to begin to look at the packs, which the launcher advertises whenever you open the game. Buying packs is expensive. There are so many that it can be overwhelming to pick, especially since many of them seem like they add essential features that you need. And worst of all, purchasing these packs will not fix your game. It will actually make it worse. For every tiny bit of gameplay you will also have to put up with more annoyances, longer loading screens, and more bugs. And there will be many bugs. Some of them are bad enough to corrupt save files and crash the game. But because packs are so expensive, you try to convince yourself that it isn't so bad. You may even spend more money, and feel more indebted to this game. How could these packs be so expensive and so shallow, so broken? You may think it is your fault, that you are missing something, that you made the wrong purchases. And so it looks like the only escape from the hole is to dig deeper. EA is a company that does not care about this game. TS4 has so many game breaking bugs, and packs that have been broken since their release years ago. They have a long history of ignoring player complaints, refusing refunds, and continuing to push new content no matter the backlash. They have no accountability, because this game is too big for a few players to hold them responsible. Every trailer hypes up every new pack as a must buy, and after release EA goes radio silent until the next new pack, leaving players to struggle with their newly broken game, because each patch breaks things further. TS4 is 10 years old. It is not going to get any better. If you are in the market for a life simulation game, then you should look at any of the recent newer entries to the genre. If you download the base game, even though it is free, it will tempt you to buy these very well advertised packs that will break your game. The game engine was terrible to begin with, and piling more content on a broken foundation only makes things worse. There are two positives to this game: first, there is a very engaging build mode, and it's quite fun to design different houses in this game. There are still bugs, but they're minimal if you don't have a lot of packs, and you can take some beautiful designs and share them on the public gallery for others to download. Second, TS4 has a huge dedicated modding community, so if you're playing on PC and can mod your game then you can get so much engaging and interesting content for free thanks to the work of these talented players. I don't think they're enough to make this a good game, but you may feel differently. If you already own the game and are thinking of buying a pack, three rules to follow: 1) look up several gameplay videos. Make sure they're complete, with no cuts to hide bugs or annoyances. There's a million different Sims channels on Youtube, so do your research. 2) Never buy a pack full price. There are enough sales that you can wait until it's at least half off. 3) NEVER preorder a pack. They will try to entice you with exclusive content, but it is not worth it. New packs are always broken and may not get fixed for months, if at all. But if you don't own this game, don't get it. The sunk cost fallacy is the main reason for this game's success, and EA have very good advertisements and a huge online community to encourage you to spend a little more. Maybe this time the game will be worth it. Maybe this time they'll be different. But after 10 years of consistency, maybe its time to accept that there never was a good game here, and it's time to let go.",183,5,-1,February 9

EA doesn't respect the players enough to make a functional game with features they would actually enjoy, especially when compared to the previous sims games. DLC is disgustingly expensive for the amount of content you get and often has game breaking bugs. You can no longer customize patterns, create custom sim hair or eye colors, or make custom neighborhoods. It feels really nerfed and limited compared to Sims previous versions, especially 3.

Axiam,Axiam,"Product received for free I still miss The Sims 3. It was more immersive. The Sims 4 is a downgrade in many areas. - No open world. - Removed colour wheel and pattern options. - It's been out since 2014 but still have not added cars, bikes, and other vehicles in the game. ""Life Simulator"". - The sims animations are wonky! Everyone acts like cartoons. It ruins the immersion. Needs more maturity. - DLCs are overpriced, most of them contain content which should have been included in the base game itself. It just feels like there was so much potential to this game which was wasted. There are many things that are an improvement to The Sims 3 like the Build Mode, CAS, Clay-like looking SIms, UI, Multi-Tasking, Inclusiveness, etc. it is a good standalone game (when not compared to TS3 and its nostalgia).

MatureContent,D4_,"TL;DR: This review focuses on The Sims 4 DLCs because I believe they're necessary for a fun experience, but they're expensive. If you can't or won't spend twice the cost of the main game on DLCs, I can't recommend the game. I won't go into detail about how The Sims 4 works because most people know how these games function. But, I want to mention that this game doesn't have an open world like The Sims 3, and the worlds are much smaller. However, the game has decent content, but it can feel empty without DLCs. So, if you plan to buy The Sims 4, I recommend purchasing a few DLCs. It's costly, but I think it's necessary to enjoy the game. Below are some DLCs that I recommend, but only if they're on sale (at least 30% off). I only recommend DLCs that I have played or know are good. Tiny Living Stuff: This is a cheap and fun DLC. It allows you to build super small houses with compact furniture, making it possible to fit 5 to 6 houses on the same lot. It's unique and adds a new dimension to the game. Seasons: This DLC adds four seasons with holidays, new items, and activities. It also adds new weather and ways to die. (Pro tip: you can kill your simmers really fast in a frozen pool.) Get Famous: This is a decent DLC for its price, especially when it's on sale. It's great if you care about fame and money, and you need this DLC to become an actor. Get To Work: This DLC is a must-have, as it adds active careers to the game, the option to become a store owner, and hospital visits. ""Cats & Dogs is the only DLC I own but unfortunately cannot recommend. I felt compelled to mention it, as it's typically the go-to expansion pack for new players, and with good reason - it was highly regarded in previous Sims titles. However, in The Sims 4, it adds little content beyond cats and dogs and is plagued with numerous bugs. Adopted pets often become stuck, leaving players struggling to figure out how to properly care for them."" In conclusion, I like The Sims 4. It's more alive in interactions than any of the previous Sims games, and the building and character creation is user-friendly. However, the cost of DLCs is quite steep, and it's frustrating that some of them aren't worth the price.",200,10,1,"June 26, 2020"

It's ridiculous that I could purchase an actual CAD program for about the same price. Like, I understand how DLC allows for new content, but the game came out 7 years ago, and i don't see the point in Deluxe Edition vs the Regular one.

76561198872853231,Miss R,"This game is great if you have most if not all the DLC packs that is. Do not get this game if you are not willing to spend ¬£1,099 to get the DLC packs as the base game hasn't got a leg to stand on. Most of these packs include content that should have already been included in the game that is a simulation of life. For example, weather and seasons, a big part of the real world, however, costs you an additional ¬£34.99 to get in this simulation. This game includes hardly any content without the DLC anything from clothing options to furniture. even if you buy most, even all these packs in a sale at a 50% reduction you are still paying ¬£549+. After doing some research into the costs of DLC (all together) when I play the game I forget its worth ¬£1000+ since most of the content in these packs is mediocre, some of them not being able to justify the price point. Some of the best packs included, however, seem as though it should have been base game, seasons, of course, is the first that comes to mind, but the get to work pack, a pack included 2 of the most well-known careers (IRL) costs ¬£34.99. A long story short is that the base game is no more than 2 stars it has hardly any replayability since it's so boring and there is no substance or any objective to work towards. however the game with packs (despite the costs) is a pretty good game and is debatably a 5-star game, that is if this game is for you. it best fits someone who likes a game at their own pace with comedic features and (with packs) a lot of depth into the sims worlds which can be made your own. The sims 4 is a game that has to be built one DLC at a time and for that reason, it is not a good game, a good game shouldn't have to depend on DLC the DLC should be added benefit but this is not a simulation game without way more then half the packs they sell.",144,11,1,March 11

kosmozuikis,Kosmozuikis,"Abu labl dabukatu abab gugaloobaboo After years of waiting Sims 4 is on steam finally. I've waited for this day so much. Sims 4 is a perfect game to relax or just failing at your sim life just like your real life. Or maybe you want to realize your broken dreams or deepest desires? Play it then. It's good old sims but unfortunately it has some bad old problems. Since the very first game I couldn't understand and it was annoying me badly, why the time goes so fast that you spend half of the day in the bathroom, making meals and eating. But this so far the only one significant negative point I could think of. Character creation is greatly improved. You have much more freedom to create your character. You can alter your body greatly, adjust the weight, lots of customization options and if you add mods you basically can create whoever you like. There's also gender options&preferences so LGBT people won't feel neglected here. You can also pick few perks for your sim, positive or negative it's up to you, your life goal, your temper and so on. There's a lot replayability value in this game due to how different your sim can be each time. After creating your sim as you already know you pick the house and start your life. There are life goals, job, relationships. My favorite activity so far is beating my neighbor every few days. I don't know why, anger issues probably. Of course most the time passes when you're at work and sleeping so just like in real life there's not a lot of time left for something else. Feeling tired and don't want to start talking with people? Go troll teh forums. Or give money to charity...which apparently was a scam. Then go outside beat your neighbor again and insult him. Then go play piano while other people do pushups beside you. Come back home call the girl, have some fun time, eat leftovers and go to sleep. Or maybe you want to live in a cute world by building your perfect house decorated with unicorns and rainbows? Ok lets get serious. The map is pretty small and while there's a lot to do and achieve there's still too little content. I kind of understand and agree with DLC expansions. This is not a yearly franchise, the game is supported for years so having DLC's is not a bad practice, plenty of very successful games do that and community loves them. They add content you might be interested and you're not forced to buy a new game each year. From seasons, pets to vampires. There's also some cosmetic DLC's which are not necessary at all. I love this DLC model but the problem with it is the pricing. DLC's a greatly overpriced. Yes it's good letting you choose what you want while supporting developers, but seriously these prices are insane. DLC's like seasons, university, pets should either be included in the game or sold at much lower prices. The ones like star Wars or Vampires are different thing, they feel out of context and more resembles real additional content. Not everyone is interested in those so it makes sense selling them separately and maybe at slightly higher price. There's a lot of dialogue options and actions so you can approach different people as you wish. Maybe there could be slightly more choices, but it's not bad. I don't know if it's just me but managing needs feels easier in Sims 4. In previous games I had problems with various needs besides bladder and hunger of course. Here I can easily keep my Sim happy. Modding community is HUGE for this game. There are really good mods out there, mostly cosmetic stuff but you can even mod drugs, violence, murder and sex of course. It all depends on your taste but I associate Sims with innocent and cute game for escaping the real world so mods like this seems out of place. But hey they are there and it could be fun from time to time. Graphically the game is wonderful. It's far from revolutionary on a technical side obviously, but it looks great for its art-style and overall aesthetics. Small details like emotions, food, your PC screen and other small things have enough detail. Performance is very good. It runs smoothly without any lag or stuttering. This was the reason why I couldn't play Sims 3, even after applying all the fixes the lagging was annoying. Ultrawide is supported out of the box. I'm playing on 3700x, 2070s, 32GB @3440x1440 and getting 90+ fps. Sound same as graphics is great. Talking is usual Sims blabbering in alien language which is really funny, but you can easily understand if the Sim is angry, happy etc. from the tone of his voice. There's also music. You can listen to radio or play music yourself. There are few genres to choose from but I miss metal of course and maybe more songs overall. Playing instruments sounds so good, sometimes I slow the time and just listen. Great songs there. If you love Sims it's obviously a good choice because there's simply no other game which would offer something like this. But the main game lacks content so you probably will need couple of DLC's to enrich the fun or maybe simple mods will be enough. Anyway at a sale price it's a no brainer. One thing i really wish and that would very simple to add are achievements, please EA do it. Pros Good graphics Great performance Good customization Cute Replayability Good sound design&music Plenty of mods Cons Lacks core content which is locked to DLC's Overpriced DLC's Some activities take way too much time No achievements Verdict: 82/100 Follow my curator page for more My Twitch [www.twitch.tv]",233,17,1,"November 30, 2020"

the_holysword,Holysword,"I was a big fan of the first game of the series and had a lot of fun with custom content, which you could download from fan sites. The Sims 4 is definitely not bad, but lacks a soul element. Most of the mechanics are still the same, or have been improved, but there are some weird choices (e.g. building a spaceship in your backyard) and some wackiness that seem too far off. That would be all okay though. What kills it, runs it over, beats it to a pulp, sets it on fire and then buries it in forty-five different graves is the business model of the game. The base price is 40‚Ç¨, currently with 45 DLCs, divided into - expansion packs = 40‚Ç¨ each - game packs = 20‚Ç¨ each - content kit = 5‚Ç¨ each - ""stuff"" packs = 10‚Ç¨ each (there might be some other BS I'm missing) The developers made it so that The Sims 4 has become more an online store for online furniture than a game. This is not acceptable. I believe that gamers should stand up and boycott whoever is responsible for this madness.

I'm not saying the game isn't worth it, trust me, it's super entertaining!! But it'd be so much more inclusive and player friendly if the DLC didn't come with such a hefty price tag.

cyx6six,evangeline,"by far the best game in the sims franchise in terms of visuals, however, base gameplay is severely lacking. the sims 4 feels like a step down to it's predecessors and is absolutely a cashgrab. $900 for all the dlc? screw you ea. you can also tell that the targetted demographic has shifted by comparing the sims 2 and sims 4 trailers (worth your while, i recommend you do it). definitely play sims 3 if you are looking for gameplay, you won't find as much content in this game compared to the sims 3. the sims 4 is definitely more of a building game, whether it be designing houses or building sims. the gameplay is lacking in this game and a lot of features that were in sims 2 and 3 are missing from this game unfortunately. it seems the main focus in this game was simply visuals, you can only play the base game for so long before getting bored and modding the hell out of it. dlcs are not worth it in my opinion. $40 for cats and dogs? ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you ea.  i hope that this is not the beginning of the sim franchise's downfall as the sims was a massive part of my childhood and i'd hate to see 22 years of this franchise go down the drain thanks to the hands of ea. overall, i do and don't recommend this game. the sims to me has been a big part of my childhood but unfortunately i will not continue to follow the franchise if it continues in the directive that ea has taken it now. it's definitely lacking and it seems the devs are busy milking as much money out of it as they can opposed to making a new addition to the franchise. there are still many bugs and many features that cost money that should be a part of this game for free, such as seasons or holidays. don't buy this game or dlc full price, it's absolutely not worth it.",112,3,1,"April 23, 2022"

76561198116919915,Toasty Jackson,"The Sims 3 is also on Steam, and it's cheaper. Just something to consider. tl;dr: it's fun enough to be worth getting the base game and some expansions on sale, but, if you have the willpower, it's probably better to be a conscientious objector and not encourage EA's scummy practices by giving them money for this--although there are enough sim simps that I doubt your righteous protest will be enough to make a difference in the long run. Anyway, I'd recommend this one still if you get it on sale. The base game goes on sale for as low as $5 at times, and, while it's lackluster, it's worth at least that much. And the 2000 expansion, game, and stuff packs also get on pretty good deals sometimes. Even then, you'll still feel like you're spending too much money, but it won't hurt as much. The thing is, the game is fun. The packs are underdeveloped and overpriced, but most of them are still fun in their own ways. The devs really knocked it out of the park by making a game that's both so poorly-developed that it's infuriating but also still fun enough that you'll be willing to still play it and shell out money for at least some expansions out of the hope that they'll fix the game. The DLC model of the game is abysmal. So many of the packs are things that should absolutely have been in the base game or at least added as a free update--like Seasons, Get Together, Cats & Dogs, and Parenthood to name a few. Like, this game is all about interactions and relationships between people. They didn't flesh out the parent/child aspect of the game enough, and they want us to shell out an extra $20 for them to make it marginally better? Gtfo. The game is fun, and its vibrant modding community of people that love this game more than the devs makes it better, but it's also incredibly disappointing. I've gone back and forth on whether or not to recommend this several times just while writing this review, but I guess it's fun enough for it and some of its DLC to be worth it--if they're on sale, that is.",195,5,1,"April 7, 2021"

1941198419991923,Tigershark1968,"My wife has been playing Sims 4 since it came out on Origin.  She stopped playing it for over 2 years due to Origin issues.  It's now installed on the EA App and working well.  She has all the ad on's and has an unbelievable 6,890 hours & 25 minutes of play time in the game. I used to see my wife.  They were fun times.  If anyone sees her, tell her she's killed another 2 of her Sims in a fire while she was making her coffee.  A regular thing I can assure you.  By that I mean the Sims being brutally killed in ""accidents"".   I sleep with one eye open.   I look at this game as being a serial killer starter kit, posing as a game about social development.",276,500,1,"October 18, 2022"
76561198024928793,Savestate,"This is a write up on what happens if you already own Sims 4 on Origin and buy it on Steam. = Installing = The Origin and Steam install are in separate locations so everything will have to be redownloaded.  Any DLC you've bought in Origin will appear in game (but not in Steam).  Oddly there's no download progress for DLC bought in Origin and downloaded with Steam.  It just states ""a background download is in progress"".  Also, Origin now shows me two copies of The Sims 4 - one version is normal while the other is marked as ""Steam"". If you want to go back to the Origin version just uninstall the Steam version.  Steam will delete it's installed copy of the game.  When you launch Origin it will think Sims 4 needs to be reinstalled.  Since the original Origin install folder is still there it will quickly verify everything and you'll be back to normal. = Running the Game = When you launch the game from Steam it fires up Origin.  When you launch the game from Origin it fires up Steam.  Even if you launch the Origin installed version of the game the Steam version supersedes it.  So if you install both an Origin and Steam version of the game it will always launch the Steam version. = Sales = The Sims 4 now has different in-game store fronts.  Right now there are no sales going on in Origin so that version of the game just shows all my unowned DLC at regular price.  But Steam IS having a sale so running that version of the game shows all the DLC at a discount.  I didn't buy any DLC from Steam so I'm not sure what happens with that. = Saved Games and CC = Both versions of the game use the same ""My Documents"" location for saved games and CC.  There should be no issues with that once all your DLC is installed. = Bottom Line = If you have any real investment in the Origin version then I'd say stick with that.  If you're new to Sims 4 then Steam is probably better.  The dual client thing is annoying since you need to wait for Origin and Steam to launch but Steam is the more robust client.  If the Steam version wasn't tied to Origin then I'd absolutely recommend dropping Origin but since you need both it's not worth the hassle to transfer to Steam.  Hopefully EA will get a clue and fully merge Origin and Steam accounts and just get rid of Origin.  The fact that Titanfall 2 bombed on Origin and is a huge success on Steam should be all the proof EA needs.",64,0,1,"July 2, 2020"
babylullaby,babylullaby2,"The base game is deplorable in the complete lack of content it brings, and is virtually unplayable by itself.  The game can however be really fun with the addition of a few good DLCs on sale and mods. Here are the ones I recommend vs. don't recommend having played with most of the expansions except eco lifestyle. Highly recommended: 1. Sims 4 Get Together: The most underrated sims expansion pack. Allows you to create unique mini-communities that your sim would be part of, either it be family, or coworkers, or hobby groups. Super useful in everyday game play. I use it to make family gatherings, after work hangouts, holiday parties...etc. The groups also allow you to modify other sim's behaviour based on your expectations which really adds realism to the game play. 2. Sims 4 Cats & Dogs: Pets in the sims are a favourite of mine. Sucks that we don't have horses like the sims 3 but I am overall very happy with the cats & dogs expansion and I like the new vet career as well. 3. Sims 4 Seasons: Self-explanatory. Adds seasons to your game. Sims behave differently based on different seasons. Also adds holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day etc. Highly recommend for varied game play. 4. Sims 4 Parenthood: Adds activities to toddlers, children & teens in the game. Allows sims to parent their kids. You can give kids chores, ground them, reward & punish them for specific behaviours etc and these actions will have impacts on your child develops. More importantly, this is a game pack so it is only half of the price of the expansion packs. 5. Sims 4 Dine Out: Same logic as parenthood. Allows your sim to eat at restaurants & also manage your own restaurant. One of my personal favourites. One of the better game packs. You can get a lot of hours out of this pack. Also super good for rags to riches challenges. Medium recommended: 1. Sims 4 City Living: Allows you to live in cities and brings apartments to the game. Also adds various festivals to the game which are good outing spots. Really good expansion pack but ranked lower because I don't like how in the sims 4 they split sims 3 late night into three expansion packs - city living, get famous, and vampires. 2. Sims 4 Get Famous: Allows you to become famous actor, streamer & DJ. Adds new world which is equivalent to LA in the real world with gated communities and hot venues. Really enjoyed the actor and streamer careers and I think the concept of the pack is good. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed playing with fame in previous sims games. Again ranked lower because I don't like how they split one expansion pack into three expansion packs. 3. Sims 4 University: Allows sims to go to university. Not essential to game play since sim's don't really need degree to get jobs in the sims 4. However, it is well made and recommended for people who enjoyed the university expansions in the previous sims entries. 4. Sims 4 Realm of Magic + Vampires: Essentially EA broke up Sims 4 Supernaturals and sold them in individual game packs, which is good in my opinion because then you can just purchase the occult sims that you were interested in. The realm of magic and vampire game packs actually went into each occult sim (wizard & vampires) in more details that the Sims 3 in my opinion. Rank medium because I think occult sims are not essential to game play but they are really fun and I would recommend picking up these two game packs when you get the chance. So-So recommended: 1. Sims 4 Island Living: Allows you to travel to the island world of Sulani. Adds mermaid to the game. In my opinion this should have been a game pack instead of an expansion pack. I am disappointed that they took out the resort management system that was in Sims 3 Island Paradise and I do not think this expansion much content compared to the other ones. 2. Sims 4 Get to Work: Adds several playable careers to the game including doctor, scientist, and detective. The careers are actually really fun, especially on the first few play throughs. The drawback is that the tasks gets repetitive after a while so I wish more variety was added to the mid to high stages of the career. 3. Sims 4 Jungle Adventure: Sims 3 world adventures turned into a game pack. Adds archeology into the game. Good pack but ranked lower because limited replayability and also doesn't appeal to everyone. 4. Sims 4 Tiny Living Stuff, Laundry Day Stuff, & Romantic Garden Stuff: The top of the stuff packs. Tiny living stuff because it adds interesting concepts & objects to the game. Laundry stuff because it was a community voted pack and the build items in that pack are awesome. Romantic garden stuff because it adds good landscaping objects. Weakly recommended 1. Sims 4 Spa Day. Outdoor Retreat, Bowling Night: Will use once or twice. Not that important to game play. 2. All the other stuff packs and whatnot: $$$ packs by EA. Only recommended for avid fans of the series who have a lot of $$ to spend. Not recommended 1. Sims 4 Luxury Party Stuff: Almost $1 per item. Do NOT get unless you already got it. Ugly items that you will never use. 2. Sims 4 Strangerville: Not a bad idea but zero replay value once you've been through it once. Use your money on some other game if you must get it. 3. Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle: Reviews have been horrible. There are many bugs reported online.  Community action plans are a HOT mess. Do not get it until EA fixes it.",77,0,1,"July 4, 2020"
greymatter0001,greymatter0001,"My Review of The Sims 4. The Sims 4 is arguably seen as the worst of the Sims titles. It gets a bad rep from those who prefer the previous titles. Let‚Äôs jump into this further. Here are some features and game mechanics that people usually bring up and that I personally miss. 1.	Create-A-Style The ability to change the texture, colour and material of surfaces and clothes for extended customization. 2.	Sliders for Create-A-Sim Another staple in The Sims 3 CAS was the ability to tweak the colour of your Sim‚Äôs skin and make-up to almost anything you desired giving you yet more customization and personality. 3.	Open Worlds This feature was a staple in the Sims series. It gave you the ability to move across the entire world, and see other Sims interacting with things around them. It gave the world more depth. 4.	Trait System In the Sims 2 and 3, you had a plethora of traits that you could assign your Sim giving them a more complex and realistic personality. 5.	Story Progression This isn't really a feature commonly explored in the Sims series, but it was there in tandem with the expansion packs if you so wished to pursue. Okay‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶The Sims 4 has a few technical limitations and is missing some features from previous titles that we all know and love, but people tend to highlight the faults and failures and gloss over the positives. Here are some of my personal favourites. 1.	Expanded Create-A-Sim Features Sims no longer all look the same! Did you ever notice that Sims in 2 and  3* all looked a bit similar? There weren‚Äôt many facial features or structures for you to mould to your liking. The new* click-and-drag feature in Create-A-Sim gives you so much more pliability and with preset facial features to play with, you can make something really unique. For further detail I would recommend watching The Sims 4: Create A Sim Official Gameplate Trailer 2.	Extended Build/Buy Mode Creating the perfect home has never been easier. It‚Äôs now so more fun to build than ever, and with Build & Buy Mode merged into one it‚Äôs a more fluid experience. For more detail I would recommend watching The Sims 4: Build Mode Official Gameplate Trailer 3.	The New art Style A new art style that I believe harkens back to the roots of classic style of The Sims. While The Sims 3 tried to go for the more realistic overtones, it didn‚Äôt succeed very well and sadly stepped into the uncanny valley. 4.	Multi-tasking Interactions Most* interactions are more believable. The new feature of being to multi-task is quite handy‚Ä¶and while it isn‚Äôt perfect, it still makes some* interactions more realistic and fluid rather than waiting for the next thing in the queue to happen. 5.	Hardware Performance Unlike The Sims 3, 4* is extremely well optimized. I tested this on of my lowest-spec laptops and at maximum settings  it hardly dropped in frames. Granted 3* goes for the more realistic approach but can be costly. Epilogue I think we should talk about the elephant in the room, and that is overpriced, overvalued expansion and game packs. EA have always made bad business decisions that have deterred their customers from this franchise. The one that stands out the most is the marketing DLC. In my personal opinion and the opinion of others, game packs are marketed at exorbitant prices, some costing even more than base game‚Äôs value. Believe it or not, this is still an issue even with The Sims 3. Game packs don‚Äôt seem to have decreased in value over the span of 12 years. This definitely threw me off initially‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm a sucker for interesting DLC. Note When disputing the bad business decisions, please do not confuse EA with Maxis. EA are the publishers and the ones in charge of business. Maxis are the true beholders of the Sims series. sadly, in some cases, publishers like EA turn games into cash cows and they become soulless corporate entities. After having played The Sims 4 for over 250 hours, I can definitely recommend it. I hope this short review helps you decide what to do, CeeGee.",93,0,1,"December 28, 2020"

76561197988844312,SnuskSocka,"Wow.. So where to begin? I'm not much of a The Sims fan, but I've played 1 and 2 and had fun with them for a while. Also, I'm not much of a gamer nowadays since I'm a father, having a job, and time is kinda limited to spend on my dear hobby. Nevertheless I felt obligated to post my first review because of this game. This was mostly an impulse purchase because, as I said, I did enjoy The Sims 1 and 2 and I have some money to burn, but I'm happy with steam and aren't that keen on installing other storefronts because of a game - though, when I started up the game and saw that you needed to install origin on top of Steam I thought, - ""eh, ok. I've already purchased the game so.. you win this time EA"". Sure.. I think it's scummy that you need to install one storefront on top of another storefront just to play the game but, for this instance, I gave it a pass. I don't like EA. I haven't liked EA in a long while. I'm old enough to remember a time that when you saw that EA logo appearing on the screen you knew that ""this is a top quality game I have loaded on my console/PC right now"". Wing commander, NHL 97, Syndicate, Budokan... Simcity for crying out loud.. The list is long. So. Starting up the game went smoothly, as it should, and I thought that, ""now that I own the game I could buy the DLC as well. They should have some packet deal for all the DLC for 20-30 dollars,  now that they've launched on steam and everything"". Went to the store to buy said DLC and I almost choked on my newly poured cup of coffee. Over $500!! effing USD to own all the DLC!??? That's FIVEHUNDRED US DOLLAROONIES!! And that is WITH THE 30% OFF!? I could buy a freaking Oculus Quest 128gb for that amount! Needless to say, I uninstalled the game, the origin launcher and am right now demanding a refund. I knew that EA were scummy nowadays, but man. I just hope that the poor souls that purchase all the DLC actually can afford it and are not feeding their addiction with money they don't have. This is acting just as crappy as all the mobile gacha games that are overflowing the market right now, but instead of characters they offer you chairs, tables and pets. I'm honestly surprised that they haven't incorporated lootboxes at this point. ""Tired of your boring gray chair? Well, RIGHT NOW! you can have a GREEN chair! ONLY available for a limited time if you buy the AWESOMELY AWESOME surprise mechanic LOOTEGG of AWESOMENESS! only available for a limited time"" And this is having a mostly positive score on steam? I just shake my head... Good riddance *Edit* Forgot to mention. I would gladly pay $40-50 USD for a ""Complete Edition"". It's about time by now, don't you think EA?",375,35,-1,"June 23, 2020"

OriginalXTS,XTS,"Thank you for the helpfuls and awards. I'm glad I was able to, in some way, assist you in your endeavor ^.^ 29 July 2024 Another Update: Wanted to warn anyone buying all DLC, it may include Horse Ranch twice? It is listed on the main page twice (see below for my concerns that I posted back then).  I'm not sure how it works, but I wanted to warn you. It may duplicate in the cost? I'd like to also add that they removed girlfriend/boyfriend & husband/wife. You must conform. O.o (They could've just added spouse and partner instead of replacing the originals.) I'm very disappointed in the frequent undesired changes in the game compared to before. Also Note: EA App is also Required 14 February 2024 Wanted to warn anyone who may actually be tempted to buy all DLC. The Horse Ranch DLC is listed twice. Near the top and near the bottom. 4 Mar 2023: w/ latest updates and EA Software being forced on us, Origin is gone :( And they now require us to use their EA Software. With this in mind, I've commented in a thread and want to re-post what I posted there concerning trying to launch the game with steam and how it reacts to EA Software and launching the game itself. UPDATE: Seems if you clear cache and just close down both steam and ea, then reboot your PC that you can then launch it from steam but I recommend you open them both before you launch via steam. I tried from desktop and that did not launch EA Software properly. IDK if adding EA Software to Steam's Programs would help but I worry it'll affect play time documented, which is cool to see. Update 2: I tried again today. I do my typical routine of steam stuff. I then go to launch the game and so it begins. I've tried verify integrity. I've tried clearing cache on both EA Software & Steam Cache. Both cause you to have to log in again. Even then I get that error, 500 and I'll know it'll be an issue before I even get to see my game page in EA Software because EA Software will launch with a yellow banner stating something is off. If the EA Software launches and does NOT have that yellow banner, it seems to launch each time. Once I get the game going I do not go messing with it so these tests are some time in between. I hope that helps some of you until it's fixed. I also sent an error report in EA Software (Desktop software aka EA App/Program) for PC. Restarting pc after clearing cache? IDK but that's a lot of steps. Restarting does and is part of what makes it work. The lack of yellow banner is also a part of what makes it work. Yellow banner means my game information will not be accessible because of some mysterious situation. O.o 31 Jan 2023: Newest BASE GAME update includes surgical marks for sex changes and medical clothing for gender changes. The one thing I did notice is patches that can be worn on the skin. That could be for diabetics or heart patients? I still wish it was a free DLC, then you could get more medical supplies, braces, etc. I think they added this one more for political reasons, to make a point. I prefer a free DLC of medical, or a low fee. I'd buy it as a medical care kit, if it were that. (Note: there's also no prosthetic limbs & you'll have to pay for the dentures in a cup) I think it was just a way to get their way, tbh. This is my personal opinion. *I'd love a toggle to remove all in CAS (Create A Sim) But that does not exist. :( And they throw a bunch of stuff on the sims. It will take quite a while before you can even begin to design them due to needing to remove things. I've loved sims since sims 1 (Will Wright brought it to us through someone who could help him bring his vision to life, from what I understand. The dream of seeing inside Sim City's homes.  Sims 2 forward it was a bit different. Check out the wikiipedia on it if you want more information on The Sims Franchise, early days and publishers. I've played each version and have seen how it has grown, as well as their greed :( (Sorry EA but it is true.. *Sad face*) Still waiting. Sims 4 is a really fun life simulation game with tons of mods available out there if you prefer. (just be safe with those!) I like to go to ModTheSims for mods and to Carl's Sims 4 Site for the Cheats and Tips for gameplay. https://www.carls-sims-4-guide.com/ Both sites are loaded with information! MTS is also for previous versions of sims. :) A small simple house filled with Christmas :D Only Base game, Seasons & Holiday pack used so others can use it. Nearly done but need to stop A Screenshot of The Sims‚Ñ¢ 4 By: XTS You can record in-game play and hitting tab while playing will hide the HUD. (full screen recordings) The game was $500 to get all, but since that review it is over $1000 :( :( So I removed what I had wrote about the enough for a car part. Now, enough for . a lot. It wasn't festive on the lot enough so while holding a Christmas tree I tapped the ] button to enlarge the trees. Seems to work fine :) A Screenshot of The Sims‚Ñ¢ 4 By: XTS The game is free here @ STEAM, and the packs can be bought from either. I used a Guide here on STEAM to make them linked. I moved all files over to STEAM so it's in one place. :D If you want a big hospital that is mostly realistic, works in game if you use freebuild cheat, check out my upload (Origin Username: XTSMasterID) I don't have a lot but I'm starting to share more. :) I follow for follow in there ‚ô• As long as I know. But some are ""anonymous""?? why? I've no clue. (The first Upload of the hospital, 2015) if having live babies in cribs is an issue just delete them. I didn't mean it the way it sounds. I didn't know if it'd load with live babies A Screenshot of The Sims‚Ñ¢ 4 By: XTS (I've a friend who tested this. Said it worked great for them as a hospital but you MUST use that cheat to make it work right) https://simsvip.com/2015/04/02/the-sims-4-editing-hidden-lots/ Please read other reviews for details and other perspectives. ‚ô• EDIT: It will not show your Origin hours, sadly. I have over 900 hours in this game but it only shows the base game for here and it's time.. Just head over to Origin if you own Origin and you'll see your previous hours there, as well as updated hours if you have the steam version. :) Origin should have all hours displayed though Steam only picks up when you buy STEAM base game. Origin also shows which packs you own (it shows if it's a STEAM purchase as well) so check Origin when you want to know what packs you don't have. Steam doesn't seem to be able to track that. Then go to STEAM store and ignore what you already own so you don't buy it again. 8 Jan 2022: Fun Side Story Stuff: I'd like to add for those who liked Mortimer and Bella Goth, they are in here. I've not seen Don Lothario (some of you know who I speak of). For more information, look up Lothario Definition in Google *wink* It'll explain why I am curious if he's in the game and why I look for him. Another hint is the hot air balloon in ?

hangryzombit,Hangry Zombit,"This review is for those people wanting to move their sims 4 game across to Steam: There are plenty of reviews online about the differences between sims 4 and other versions, this review is for current sims 4 players who want to play their game on Steam rather than Origin. The first thing you'll notice is you have to purchase the base game A SECOND TIME in order to play via steam. Not. Cool. EA. I have moved games from different platforms to steam many times and it was always free, this added expense is unnecessary and outright stealing from loyal players. - so, I suggest you grab the base game on steam when it's on sale if this is still the rout you want to take. The process of transferring will require you to uninstall your Origin version of The Sims 4 and re-install a Steam version of The Sims 4 (still in origin). That's right, you will still need origin to play the game. If you were hoping to ditch the origin platform think again! - this makes it almost pointless purchasing via steam if you already have the game on Origin. For first time players of the sims however I recommend purchasing via steam, just cos steam is awesome! The Origin platform is less invasive when playing the steam version of The Sims 4, just sign in once to origin when you start up the game for the first time and from that point forward you may launch the game via steam and the origin platform will not be an issue. (allow your DLC to install before launching any pre-saved games or you may corrupt your saves (make save game backups b4 changing to the steam version! Just in case)) ‚Äì your saves will be in exactly the same place as the Origin version of steam: documents/electronic arts/the sims 4/saves. On a positive note you will not need to re-purchase any of your DLC - thank you! thank you! thank you! I'm so glad they have allowed this. But I'm not sure any DLC will be purchasable via steam at this point, all DLC may need to be purchased via the Origin platform. so again, why bother getting the steam version of the game if you already have it on origin along with all your DLC? One reason you may want the steam version is to take advantage of the Steam Overlay. You can stream and chat with fellow steam owners from the steam overlay in game. (still not a selling point though since you can do just that by adding The Sims 4 as a non-steam game on steam‚Ä¶ I think the overlay works when you do this but I‚Äôm not sure), somebody please check and comment thanks! Another reason you may want The Sims 4 on steam is to take advantage of the steam achievements and badges. Yes, The Sims 4 on steam has badges! Go get your ranks up everybody!! I guess it all comes down to WHY you want The Sims 4 on steam, if you just prefer steam than by all means, get the sims 4 on steam, transfer everything across, Bob‚Äôs your uncle. It supports the steam community, so if you do, thank you! If you don‚Äôt have the cash to purchase the base game a second time than it‚Äôs probably not worth it. If you don‚Äôt care about steam achievements, badges or the steam overlay, it‚Äôs probably not worth it. If all you want to do is uninstall the Origin platform and play on steam‚Ä¶ well you can‚Äôt, so get over it! IMO I got the game on steam because I like steam, I like being on steam, I‚Äôve always wanted to have The Sims 4 on steam, and I think EA have made a pretty good compromise here, they are giving us what we want but still getting what they want. (They probably just want more money ‚Äì so long as Steam is somehow benefiting from this deal than meh! I don‚Äôt care, I have the game on steam now, I‚Äôm content).",86,8,1,"June 23, 2020"

Anonymous3312,WatermelonDuck,"Playing the Sims is great, it's a childhood classic, brings me back to when I first entered the world of PC games. It gets depressing around 4am when I realise I've been playing for hours on end, sat by myself, playing the life of someone who is more successful, funnier, more attractive, wealthier and generally better off than me, living in my dream house. I don't want a big house, nothing fancy - I don't like the idea of having to do a lot of extra cleaning. But having a spare room and maybe a small pond would be nice. My sims always have so much space for an allotment. In this economy, how are you meant to have an allotment? It's ridiculous. Plus my sims usually have at least 8 friends. I can only aspire to that.",140,56,1,"November 25, 2021"

You can no longer choose your own customized colour or pattern for objects, just what they have given you. They've given you 24 colours for hair, no own colouring possible. The DLCs are all super expensive and I guess you would need them, because the vanilla game is pretty boring (but especially because they've cut the open world, I feel imprisoned in this game). You still need trash Origin to launch it (and no one likes Origin).",208,6,-1,"August 9, 2021"
mxhardy,Hardy,"I only played original The Sims over twenty years ago. That says something about my age, doesn‚Äôt it. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever come back to the series. Lately I checked out new early access game The Tenants which borrows some Sims mechanics and that was what reignited my curiosity after so much time. Many things have already been said about EA‚Äôs greediness. I haven‚Äôt seen this amount of DLC for any other game I played, especially not as overpriced. Good thing is you definitely don‚Äôt need all of them. Many of the stuff packs is just minor cosmetics. As far as expansion packs and game packs go, below is an exhaustive list of essentials which will make your base game experience richer. Only first three are a necessity: Seasons ‚Äî for having‚Ä¶ well, seasons, and a calendar of events throughout the year Cats & Dogs ‚Äî if you‚Äôd like four-legged friends run around your house and neighbourhood Parenthood ‚Äî catered to family-oriented players, provides deeper mechanics for raising your in-game children Laundry Day ‚Äî adds the aspect of having to clean your clothes, extends gameplay immersion Nifty Knitting ‚Äî one additional activity for your Sims (very cute) Perfect Patio ‚Äî useful stuff for decorating house outside Juggling between EA Play subscription, Steam bundle offers and major sale events (happen 2-3 times a year) you can complete your desired set much cheaper than the asking price. Other DLC can be looked into every now and then. It‚Äôs definitely not needed all at once from the beginning. As a person who only played The Sims back in 2000 I quite like this fourth instalment in 2021. I know it‚Äôs already seven years old, and it took a long time for it to be where it is right now. Non-overwhelming interface, responsive controls, fairly big selection of build/buy items (lately Maxis added over 1000 new colour swatches to over 120 base game items). Game works great on SSD, GTX1060 and a five year old CPU. Steam integration is flawless, Origin starts quickly in the background and shuts down automatically right after you close the game. I could only wish for Steam achievements. I like that this game can be played in so many ways ‚Äì shoutout to all you fantastic builders out there! ‚Äì but also in terms of using/not using cheats or creating different starting scenarios. I like Sims‚Äô traits, aspirations and whims which add more to the gameplay. I very much like the inclusivity. The one aspect that surprised me the most in a positive way is gardening. I also love the overall sense of humour, not only in regards to gardening. How about growing that Cowplant, anyone? Or maybe a Money Tree is more up your alley, huh? Be warned ‚Äì once you‚Äôre hooked, three hours of your real life will fly by like an hour, and this is still an understatement. As for the product itself, choose your purchase timings wisely so you don‚Äôt go bankrupt IRL. Happy simming! 8/10",83,2,1,"September 27, 2021"

nicoleoreo,Oswin,"Here's what happens if you are transferring from Origin to Steam: *You need to buy and reinstall the Base game again on Steam, but not the DLCs (seasons, spa, bowling, etc.) *All save files and household will still appear as they were in your game. *When you go to play it, Steam will launch origin, where you will find a new game in your library called the Sims 4, but this one has the Steam logo on it. *Because your DLC was purchased on your Origin account, it will show as already purchased for this new game as well, but you WILL need to reinstall it on the new game... Which takes forever. Saying all that, is it worth it? Personally, the reason I got it was because for the life of me, I could not figure out how to switch languages and as I love the sims, I wanted to use it in another language I'm trying to learn. Steam was able to let me do that finally and extremely easily! So far I'm really enjoying it and learning a lot. Also, I like the Steam interface and the befits of being able to connect with friends on Steam while gaming and I'm expecting easy mod downloads with workshop. Plus for future DLC, the sales definitely come to mind. I got the base game while it was on sale, and I think for me personally it was worth it, but just so you know, this is what transfer will be like. Might not be worth it for everyone. But anyways, Sim on everyone! XD",76,0,1,"July 10, 2020"
76561198318232080,TheConfusedTissue,"This game has been very disappointing for me. I bought everything on sale, and I still feel like I paid too much. It lacks the necessary game play elements that made the other games lively (meaningful events, depth to sims, focus on all generations rather than just young adults, memories, ect). I'll keep playing it, but only with the help of mods. The packs are just as disappointing. Discover Universities doesn't work with rotational game play, the Vampires and Making Magic expansions had some pretty great innovations to the magic systems, but the neighborhood was too small. Get to Work was fun, but the store part of the expansion can't run unless you're actually there and at the store. Dine Out is buggy, and it takes hours for sims to eat their food, but at least it kinda works. Cottage Living is actually great, and it has just as much content as the trailers showed if not more. Wedding Stories, on the other hand, does not. Plumbella's recent videos showed that it wouldn't even start the wedding sometimes, and even if the wedding goes off without a problem, there's no opportunity for drama! You can't leave people at the altar, you can express doubts about getting married but it's a positive interaction, and there's no aspirations. It feels very flat, especially when compared to the trailer. If you are going to buy the game, get it on sale. Even then it's a toss up whether you'll be getting everything you paid for, or if you'll be disappointed. You'll be paying for buggy content that might get fixed in a few months, but hey, at least the aesthetics look great? I actually like the cartoony design of the sims 4, but I don't like how the depth of the game became more shallow.",152,6,-1,"February 23, 2022"

mirageanne,Mirage Anne,"As a long-time fan of The Sims franchise, I have mixed feelings about The Sims 4. On its own, the game is undeniably fun, with improved graphics and smoother gameplay compared to its predecessors. It shines in areas like character customization and building mechanics, offering players endless possibilities to create and shape their Sims' world. If you're looking for a casual, life-simulation experience, Sims 4 delivers, but it comes with a serious caveat. The real issue is the aggressive monetization strategy. The sheer amount of DLC content that feels like it should have been part of the base game is, quite frankly, ridiculous. Key features that many players loved in Sims 3, such as university life, pets, seasons, and even simple tasks like laundry, are all locked behind paywalls. To get the ""complete"" experience, you're looking at spending hundreds of dollars, which feels like a cash grab from the developers. It makes me long for the days of Sims 3 when the base game was robust, and DLCs felt more like fun add-ons rather than essential expansions. For those who don't want to fork out the extra cash, mods are a great alternative. The Sims 4 modding community is incredibly talented and dedicated, often releasing content that rivals or even surpasses the official DLCs. With mods, you can enjoy much of what the DLC offers without breaking the bank, though it does require some trial and error to avoid game-breaking issues. Overall, I do recommend Sims 4 because it's a solid life simulation game and has some genuinely enjoyable moments. But be warned‚Äîwithout DLC or mods, the experience can feel limited. The game desperately needs a competitor to shake up the market, because while Sims 4 can be fun, it also feels like it's gouging its players at every turn. Verdict: 7/10‚ÄîGreat base, but you need mods or DLC to unlock its full potential.",64,0,1,September 13

76561198176778430,657mrw,"Product received for free I picked this game up for free in a Christmas sale, and it's aight. The biggest problem with it is that if you want all the DLC, it's gonna run you a total of $1200, and rising because new DLC are constantly coming out, and usually they're either $10 for stuff in build mode, or upwards of $30-$40 for content packs with new jobs, building locations, etc. If you want my advice, download mods off of Nexus instead of DLC. They're free and give you individual stuff rather than whole packs of DLC. Be warned though, a lot of the mods on Nexus are 18+, so if you don't wanna see that stuff, then probably don't visit the website. Overall, if you're the kind of person to be patient and you don't want to play with every DLC a game has, then yeah, The Sims 4 is a great game. Wait for DLC to go on sale, (sometimes for free) and download them then. However, if you want to play a game with everything it has to offer, then this one isn't a keeper, as downloading all the DLC would take days, let alone the ~$1200 price tag.",65,2,1,May 28

76561197993899544,Polarization,"It was a Tuesday, I had returned from a thankless and pointless days work unusually to be greeted by my child's beaming face full of excitement. I managed to maintain eye contact long enough for her to inform me that she required a new game, evidently as she demonstrated purely on the recommendation of some generic man child YouTubers obnoxious Sims 4 reaction videos. I tried to explain to her that I did not think it was age appropriate and that it would not hold her attention for long, but she firmly insisted and when I suddenly noticed my wife's stern disapproving look rapidly forming I immediately demurred and agreed post haste to purchase with the quick proviso that this would not include any of the DLC's as they cost more then Daddy makes in a month at work. The feeling of euphoria that overwhelmed me when I saw the game was on sale is almost indescribable, my whole body was pulsating and flowing with loving tingly energy for my beautiful lord Gaben, I allowed myself  to close my eyes for just a moment to witness his magnificent cherubim form majestically aloft amongst the clouds in heaven. After making a brief 15 min power point presentation on the importance of the nuclear family for western prosperity and society and the value and superiority of the capitalist system I felt secure that my 6 year old daughter was firmly mentally prepared to begin playing Sims 4. As she went through the initial creation of her first Sim there was a moment of confusion when I had to explain to her without fully appreciating the ramifications that she needed to make a young adult version of herself as her avatar as children would  have no agency or capability for self reliance. After a modest starter home had been procured and a reasonable starting allowance for furnishings and sundries had been provided  I sat back satisfied at a job well done and full of anticipation to witness my daughters fledgling first steps into the real world. I was sure my loving care and guidance would help form her and her Sim into the very model of a productive member of society. Daddy how do I get money for things she immediately asked, you need to get a job I excitedly answered as I encouraged her to peruse the job market and start sending applications. The first alarm bells were going off, she was hesitating to seek gainful employment, I explained you wont be able to buy the things you want unless you get a job to earn money. I eagerly awaited the moment my daughter would understand the reality of the situation, but she replied no daddy I can marry someone who pays for everything like mommy, when I explained that not everyone is as generous as daddy she replied then I can sell these things in my house to get money. She then proceeded to rapidly sell the bed, toilet and kitchen everything all gone the house was completely empty only to enable her to immediately fill it with thoroughly impractical pointless frivolous nonsense. After she became frustrated that her Sim quickly became tired, hungry, dirty and emotionally distraught I pointed out that she now had no way to eat, sleep, wash or even leave the house as all the doors and windows had been sold. After thinking for a moment she then informed me that she did not need any of that as she could go to live in other peoples houses and use their bathrooms, kitchens and beds and if she needed money she could take things from their houses. I began to panic and I could see Sims 4 was morally corrupting my daughter and undoing years of careful parenting in only a few moments, after her Sim was thrown out of all her neighbours houses for trespassing and free loading my daughter decided she wanted to be a mother. Yes I thought this could be the solution, after my daughter has the burden of a child she will surely change her ways to become more responsible, after a few minutes she had created her child, a small toddler she gleefully named Poo Boy. After me witnessing 30 mins of child abuse by my daughter that poor little boy was taken away, Im truly sorry Poo Boy I hope you find a better home with the loving parents you deserve. My daughter now rapidly losing interest in the game declared she wanted a pet specifically a cat, when I looked at the price of the single Sims 4 Cats & Dogs DLC my rage with almost unbridled, I wanted to scream at the unholy injustice but barely managed to maintain the semblance of sanity, my left eye twitching uncontrollably through gritted teeth I asked my daughter to solemnly agree this would be the only DLC she would ask for. When she promised me it would be I frantically justified the outrageous price to my self, if this was the price of happiness for my daughter it was a cross I was willing to bare just this once, damn you EA, damn you to hell. After 5 mins my daughter was bored of her new cat. My child's needy demanding voice was like knives piercing deep into my soul, daddy I want to be a vampire and go on holiday and get married and be famous, could she really be my progeny I wondered how could she of betrayed me like this. NO ! I bellowed in her tiny face as loud as my soyboy beta lungs could muster No more DLC's you promised me I said, my daughters face erupted in tears and screams of anguish. My wife was upon me like a wild animal her face furious with the thermonuclear potential of a thousand suns seething in her eyes her utter contempt for my very existence plainly evident, You will get her what she wants she screamed inch's from my face. Immediately and humiliatingly all my resistance deflated like a wet paper bag , realising I was completely and utterly in the wrong to meekly without hesitation agree to purchase every DLC my daughter desired. Whilst clicking add all DLC to cart and noticing the combined cost of 57 DLC's was just shy of $1000 I barely felt the last shred of dignity and last hope of masculinity slip away from me forever to be lost like my soul. Thank you EA for irrevocably damaging my daughter morally, bankrupting me and ending my marriage. Looking back on it all now at least I can be thankful that after we lost the house and my wife and daughter are gone forever, I can still take some solace in vicariously always now having a perfect life in Sims 4 thanks to all those wonderful DLC's that improved my life immeasurably which in a way is almost consolation enough.",296,580,1,"October 16, 2022"

76561198038610193,knotyurz,"As is typical for EA, you pay quite a lot for a game filled to the brim with bugs and glitches. It takes weeks or months for them to iron out the problems with one expansion pack (which you pay for separately) or an update, and by the time that's resolved, they're releasing something else that breaks the game. The game is playable without mods, but for any reasonable level of functionality, and certainly to make it enjoyable to play for any period of time, CC and mods are what make the game worthwhile. But EA treats the content creators very poorly, despite the hours of unpaid labor they're pouring into the game to make it a good experience for players, and every update breaks most of the mods. So every time there's an update, you have to decide whether to wade through all the bugs and hope there's nothing that erases your legacy saves (as happened to many people in the last update) or to just not play for an undetermined period of time until most of it is fixed and the bugs go back to being quirky instead of game-ending. At the moment, I decided to stop playing my regular saves, due to the dangerous, game-breaking bugs, and to create a new character. Unfortunately, I was unable to get out of CAS without restarting several times, and now I can't even save the hours of work I put into creating the Sim. So, my recommendation is to not even get started with the game, and you won't feel any disappointment from the sunk-investment fallacy.",113,4,-1,"August 2, 2022"

Some players may find it challenging to keep up with all the additional content. Limited Realism: The Sims is a life simulator with a lighthearted and often whimsical tone.

EA is greedy and deaf, the game has been out too long, the DLC is over $1k of half baked content with little to no follow through to make it playable (dine out came out in 2016 and is still unusable), the heart of the franchise has been dead since TS2, etc. I've been playing this series since 2001 or 2002 and i keep coming back for nostalgia, but at this point I don't see myself ever buying Sims content again as I can't trust EA.",53,3,-1,September 2

YouAreCutie,Bia,"As someone who's dedicated most of my gaming life to simulation games, which are essentially my go-to titles, I can't really endorse The Sims 4 over any of its earlier versions. Despite its commercial success, The Sims 4 has some specific issues that have caused quite a stir among fans online. It all started with the absence of babies, pools, and ghosts initially, and other problems emerged that didn't sit well with players. Both the base game and the various expansion packs, stuff packs, and game packs for The Sims 4 saw a significant price hike, especially with the release of Cats & Dogs. Many fans weren't happy with this move, as the increased costs imposed by EA made it even more challenging for players to afford the game's additional content. I must admit, emotions take center stage in The Sims 4, promising a shift in how Sims navigate their feelings. For the first time, we could observe our Sims experiencing emotions such as anger, frustration, fear, or even boredom and responding accordingly. The game incorporates several emotions, with some introduced through expansion packs. Although emotions were touted as a significant gameplay changer, they don't quite have the impact on the unfolding of the game as expected. Given that emotions are the primary focus of The Sims 4, it's crucial to familiarize oneself with at least the most important and common ones. The mechanics of emotions function in a simple manner, quite similar to the well-known mood modifiers from previous titles. What sets this title apart is the potential for situations, people, and even objects to influence a Sim's emotions. Furthermore, each emotion can manifest in different degrees, evolving based on the Sim's current state. For instance, a Sim could feel embarrassed, very embarrassed, and ultimately mortified‚Äîthe maximum stage of this particular emotion. One of the most persistent gripes from players regarding The Sims 4 revolves around the exceedingly fragmented content within the game. The company intentionally divided specific items or gameplay to generate more expansions or packs. A glaring example that left fans fuming was the My First Pet object pack, introducing the option to create hamsters and small animals. The discontent stemmed from the pack, launched post the Cats and Dogs expansion, which easily could have had its content seamlessly integrated into the animal-themed pack, eliminating the need for a separate sale. It's undeniable that EA's latest title has its fair share of drawbacks, but for anyone who's a fan of the franchise and enjoys simulation games, The Sims 4 still holds its ground as a reference. Boasting enhanced graphics and a handful of commendable expansions, the game certainly has its high points, delivering an enjoyable experience. Yet, its tendency to poorly recycle expansions from prior titles lends it a repetitive and eventually tiresome feel. Here's a swift and personal piece of advice: steer clear of purchasing the DLCs. Don't tumble down that rabbit hole. Opt for mods instead. They breathe more life into your base game than any DLC ever could. Plus, they won't set you back nearly as much, considering the limited value and opportunity cost of DLCs.",65,5,1,"December 10, 2022"

BottomDweller,TheBottomDwellerYT,"TL;DR: Game is ok base game wise and has it's own strengths and weaknesses, DLC definitely improves it though. Price is definitely terrible for DLC, so wait for sales. Base Game 7/10, Game with the 4 mentioned DLC 9/10 This game WITHOUT DLC is... meh. It's definitely shallow in comparison to Sims 3, and it's missing several features that seem vacant for no reason at all. An open world being one of these removed features. The moodlet system is really nice and it changes up how the game is played overall as now you ACTUALLY have to play while keeping your sim's emotions in mind. The relationships between sims are a bit more dynamic it seems, and skills that were once unnecessary are now key to making certain things go as planned like pick-up lines and jokes requiring charisma and the new comedy skill. More dynamic job systems are definitely welcome.  Some side gigs like writing and such have been reworked and even overhauled in some ways to be ultimately better. Creating a Sim is more dynamic as far as body goes, but the clothing options are severely hampered due to the inability to make custom clothing or even hair colors. The hair color options are slim, so removing the ability to have custom hair colors seems like a bad move in my opinion. The AI of sims have somehow both gotten better and worse. Sims will actually actively take care of themselves better based on what I've seen, but they also make nonsensical choices for seemingly no reason at all. For example, When instructing my sim to go indoors he picks the longest way to get there sometimes. Also, sometimes sims will have conversations while making food and even though there's an open spot at the table they will actively go to the sofa in the other room, thus ending the conversation abruptly. Aside from these gripes, I think the base game is pretty alright. Also, there are no substantial community hangouts on the map at all in the base game, only parks which is strange. The game itself is just plots to build a house and put sims in as random sims come and go from your house. That effectively brought this game down from a good game to an underwhelming meh game immediately. This means the only plot worth visiting is your own house, then you just hope that sims that have time to talk to you show up. They later added more in DLC, but this segment is for the base game. Ultimately it had me on the fence the whole time. Certainly wait till the base game goes on sale for super cheap. Once you add DLC though, this game ends up becoming great. For this segment, I have particularly gotten Get to Work, Get Famous, Get Together, and Seasons. I think these 4 are the quintessential DLC's that you must get when you can. These expansions add what the game is missing like the aforementioned local hangout spots (which are added in Get Together). The content the expansions add are definitely something worth noting. Get to Work and Get Together are the ones (in my opinon) you ought to go for first. They add what the game needed for sure, such as more interactive jobs and social hang out locations. The other two I listed add stuff like a fame system that actually works better than the one in sims 3 and seasons with more holidays than the sims 3 by a landslide (you can even make your own holidays). HOWEVER there is one glaring problem with all of the DLC's... the price tag. These DLC's have no business being priced as much as the game itself. None. So my advice, just like the base game, WAIT FOR A SALE. There's even DLC for DLC, its kind of absurd (Looking at the ""My first pet stuff pack""). Aside from pricing though, these DLC's are actually solid and even adds stuff that sims 3 didn't have/handled poorly.",51,0,1,"June 22, 2020"

Best home builder in a Sims game so far, but in all honesty I can't fully endorse a title that costs over $100 to actually experience in full. Only purchase this if you already love the Sims franchise, and even then do it when it's on sale, the base game often goes for $5 and that's honestly not terrible for what you get. I've bought two expansions on sale and in total I'm out about $20 for this game. All in all I'm pleased with my experience, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price, or even getting all the expansions.

zydrateacademy,Zydrate,"It's been difficult for me to express the joy this game has brought me. My brother played a couple of the first ones way back in the day and the idea of micro managing toiletries and doing household chores never appealed to me. I watched a let's play of a team of people seeing who can kill their sims the quickest, and while I never really plan to be that cruel, it still gave me a good look at the interface and it was the first time I thought ""hey that actually looks kind of fun"". Sure enough, I would go on to dump almost 90 hours on it within a week (my back going out and having to stay home from work helped this endeavor). It's still hard for me to explain why I love it so much. In one way, it caters to my inner character creation. My mind has always been a character generator and I've blogged and done short stories about my various characters throughout the years. This game allows me to get into their heads a bit more and live their daily lives. I have a powerful witch, a naturalist islander, a famous painter and DJ, a couple of adorable aliens... And one character whom is essentially my self-insert, a woman I wish I could be. She's a writer, and made a surprisingly decent living dumping out blog posts, reviews, and a children's book about my childhood teddy bear. If only it were all this easy in real life. That really is the appeal, isn't it? I never thought of Sims as a 'lifestyle simulator', but here we are. I wish I could go review each and every pack but I got a good chunk of them on sale through Humble Bundle, but it went directly to Origin so I can't directly review some of them. I will say that if you're reading this and wondering; Seasons and Magic are probably my top two favorite. Season adds weekly dynamic events that really help shuffle up your daily routine and get you out into the world properly. Strangerville adds a more point-and-click adventure style type game but Act 3 brought in an irritating mechanic that forced me to rush through it. I could go on all day about the packs but I'll save that for my actual blog. I'll do a short dive into the gameplay. As you might be aware you can create a sim or multiple, I believe the max is eight? I had trouble just managing four so most of my households stop at 3 and maybe a pet or two. You can indeed manage their daily toiletries but I honestly cheat in some reward store perks that shut down the needs to eat and sleep and that has paid dividends into making the gameplay more enjoyable for me personally. Regardless, I've done non-cheaty characters in solo or duo households and it can be managed once you get some of the basics down. My aforementioned writer made a small living off of publishing her books and thus lacked a proper job for a while, which in turn gave me a lot more time to manage her usual bodily functions. I will admit I don't build any damn thing from scratch but thankfully there is an online, in-game gallery where you can sift through some of your favorite creations and just plop them instantly, funds allowing. The most I do is combine and slap together premade rooms and then just work on the decor and upgrade. I never build anything myself because I just do not have the mind of an interior decorator. One quick point of contention: Loading up the gallery destroys my bandwidth. It freezes most of my computer's functions as it's loading. It hasn't caused any crashes, but my podcasts and youtube videos start having hiccups, like an old skipping CD and it's very annoying. Beyond that, everything else is a nitpick. You can go on all day about EA's general business practices. Some of the packs can be seen as simple cash grabs, and the upcoming Star Wars pack looks fun but I think it breaks the flow of the game somewhat.

Sims 4 can be a fun and neat experience, but it's just clear money grab and even after ever more extensions it's still missing core features that made previous game actually fun. Simers aren't getting their money worth and EA couldn't care less. As they have a monopoly over the genre leaving good reviews about Sims 4 can only... be a bad thing and won't make for a better gaming experience. And considering reviews are meant to inform other users about wether or not to buy the game... Well you shouldn't buy that game. If you've never played the sims before go with sims 3. The only + in sims 4 is better tools in create a sims and house building, but when it comes to fun stories and simulation, the gameplay is sooo disapointing.

metalfan1,Metalfan1,"The Sims 4 is a more optimized, somewhat more customizable yet emptier Sims 3. Very simply put, this game has a lot more to do, yet less to spend in. What do I mean? It may have more skills and more jobs (maybe on DLC but I'm positive it's fairly low on the base game), but all you can do with your skills are basically either just essential skills for jobs which, outside of them, just slightly improve your everyday life (like, sport skills allows you to do more exercise, not lose hygiene, etc), they can also help you with enviromental things, like repairing and painting for some nice decoration or basically just for money, like learning to play instruments. What's wrong about them? Nothing, really, they are basically centered on improving the enviroment of your sim (saving money by repairing yourself broken items, getting your own ingredients from your garden to cook, have better mood from decorations you made, or overall sell things like paintings, books and fruits and vegetables), BUT, once you have the highest quality items you sim needs, you're set, you can now only spend money on decoration or making your house bigger to have more space to keep buying things which can be invalidated with the traits that prevents the needs from depleting, thus no need for beds, toilets, showers, etc! So if you manage to improve most, if not all skills and get said traits, the cycle will become ""work, rest, work, repeat""! But hey!! You can socialize! That's the main point of it! Yes, sure you can! But it'll get tiring to the point you'll have kids with the whole town and still get bored! What? Only I do that? Nah, I'm sure I'm not the only one that has reached this point of boredom, right? Right...? Is this game good/enjoyable? Yeah, just try not to spend so much time in one session, or maybe try some mods or events, I haven't so I can't really talk about that",41,2,1,"May 1, 2022"

starcrescendo,starcrescendo,"Oh The Sims 4, how I longed to leave a review of this before. But oh what a surprise, you can't leave reviews on the EA/Origin app. I wonder why that is. After what seems like 100 years of them pushing this unfinished and unwanted piece of trash on us, the game is still riddled with bugs, poorly optimized, badly coded, and devoid of basic features. I would not recommend this game on my worst enemy. In Sims 4, there is a severe lack of gameplay and they stripped out half the features of the Sims 3 base game. Which in itself was a great game, lacking only in technical performance aspects and a severely aggressive micro-transaction model, and a few minor gameplay features from the previous Sims games before it. Then we arrive to Sims 4, with no more open world, now you are limited to EAs poor selection of cookie-cutter worlds devoid of life and fun places to go. You can only add a handful of buildings and 4 or 5 houses in an entire city. And then when you go to a location, random people spawn but the game can't handle more than a few, so you end up on large empty lots with nobody around. It makes no sense that a 2011 game of Skyrim which has been released on ever platform imaginable can spawn hundreds of NPCs with routines into a city and they can go about their day but EA can't manage to program a game years later that runs with a simple variable to track how much someone has to go pee pee? It is pure ineptitude and incompetence on the part of EA and their developers, or complete and brazen leadership that has no vision and no concern for the fans or the game genre. Generally, when you buy the base version of a game, and they come out with a sequel, they integrate some or most of the previous game DLC into the new one - not EA. They charge you for every single feature all over again in the form of expansion packs and stuff packs. And half of the expansion packs lack concepts and items that were in that same expansion pack for the previous game. Though EA remains committed to pushing packs out their a**, it's clear they have no intention of fixing the obvious problems in this game, and have not learned a single lesson from the obvious failures of this game to put towards Sims 5 going forward. You may see that my playtime increases in this game and question that against this review. This is because it is simply the only iteration available for this genre for which to scratch a certain gaming itch. The Sims 1 and 2, while great games, and Sims 3 as well, are plagued with issues on modern hardware. Sims 4 is the only version that works to some degree. There are some mods you can install to add some gameplay features, but the game never holds your attention for long. I find myself creating people and buildings and then getting ready to play, playing for a while, and getting bored and not playing for months. Then when I come back, all my work is gone due to game updates or the s*** EA/Origin launcher that I have to redo making all my Sims again, and repeat ad nauseam. On the horizon, are finally a bunch of competitors to this game. I anticipate that just like Cities Skylines killed EA's SimCity, and how Planet Coaster killed EA'S Roller Coaster Tycoon, the same will happen to the Sims with one of these new games that will wipe this off the face of the earth due to EA's lack of attention to fans outcries, and malicious monetization of the franchise, and failure to innovate or provide any care for gamers or respect for the series as a whole. Will Wright would be horribly disappointed to see what has become of his creation under EA.",64,0,-1,"December 3, 2023"

PinkLadyJade,Pink Lady Jade,"So far I have over 1010 hours for Sims 4 on Origin. The hour counter started all over when I came to Steam to play and had to re-download the game to Steam (this was the only issue that annoyed me) but I'm sure I'll be up to thousands of hours on Steam too. Add all that to the hours that I have played The Sims 4 or other Sims games in the past since I was 17 and that is a lot of playtime! Off and on, over 20 years of play.  Honestly most people prefer the Sims 3 because of attention to detail and more complicated personalities.. but Sims 4 has it's own charms. Personally my old SIMS favorite was The URBZ (Sims in the City)! Id LOVE to play that game again! It gave you a direct path and set achievements as well as some big personalities. So.... welcome to the SIMS if you are new!  This game is pretty hard to explain. Its what you make of it. The SIMS is like real life, all the things that happen depend on your characters choices. That the base game itself stands alone well and you don't need to get the packs and extensions. If you do get them however, most of them will create a new way to play and sometimes a new town or a new world. So honestly, to me that is kind of like a new game. I enjoy getting the packs, but they do usually cost the price of a new game. There are also smaller packs and add ons that are pretty fun too. Again, the packs aren't needed though. The game is unique and interesting by itself. You will never find another game where the characters come to life like this. Games typically center around a goal that your character must accomplish. The environment, people around them and the reactions of your character are written out already and pre-planned. You are watching the game play out the way that it will play out for millions of other players. The SIMS however never plays out the same way. Even when players try the same Sims challenges the turn out will be different and the interplay and things that happen will be random and totally different. The SIMS characters have minds of their own (like AI), their own feelings and their own changeable and achievable dreams. * * *That is what I love the most about the SIMS* * *. The psychology and realism of play when it comes to personalities, emotions, psychology, relationships and life events is wonderful. It is the whole reason I play. Avatars and characters in other games just do not have the random emotions or random decisions like the characters in the Sims. Each time you open the game there are so many random things that can happen. Your own SIM character will have its own mind and so will every SIM in the game that interacts with your Sim. The interplay between characters is what gets interesting. Just be sure to learn to take care of their needs and balance fun with work and life with dreams and their life should end up entertaining (and funny). As your character ages they will change and grow and develop skills, traits, abilities, favorites and more.... they will most likely have spouses, children and even grand-children and each of them will be different as well. Your SIMS can have pets too (and new to the game are farms!). And once they retire and age and eventually die you can switch your mindset to guiding the lives of their kids and grand-kids... it all goes on forever. The life of your sim is a little world of its own with no specified goal just like real life. You are not made to do anything but exist, eat, sleep, wash, go to the bathroom, and have a bit of fun. Everything else about their life or goals or destiny is just dreamt up by the player. Your character can dream of any kind of life and each kind of life is a new game in itself. One SIM could want to be homeless and living in a tent from town to town, another could become the most famous actor ever. Your character can be a hardworking you-tuber or a scientist who gets abducted by aliens. Be a detective and solve crimes or be a veterinarian. You can now even be a Jedi or work for the empire. You can have a cottage with a little farm or be an interior designer. You can work with the paranormal and catch ghosts or just raise a family. There is so much open to you that you are creating your own game. You can also farm in your garden, make money from knitting or just be a mommy with tons of babies. You can own a dog, cat or even animals like leopards. The CC (custom content) that players create is all downloadable for free on safe websites and is also accepted and encouraged for use in the game so that opens up hundreds of opportunities as well. If you are creative at all you wont be able to stop dreaming in this game. There is always something new to do. The cannon characters are great as well. Each character from the game creator will be complicated, different from any others and surprising. All the characters are lgbtq friendly as well. THE SIMS had lgbtq characters back before anyone else. You can add to your cannon SIMS town by making your own new neighbors for your town and replacing all the original neighbors with characters you custom make, or you can stick with the old favorites.  My favorite cannon family is the Goth family (who since the first game were the Adams family of the Sims). Sure their house in SIMS 4 isnt as spooky as it becomes later in their cannon story (sims 1 and sims 2 are later in the timeline), but you can make it as spooky as you like once you play since you can edit all the land, houses and characters in town. Bella Goth is my favorite SIM and has always been kinda why I play.. great personality, spoOOoky oOOoooky family. Enjoy this game. Make it whatever you want. Also... if you become a fan and start wanting to play the older games you will never be disappointed. Each SIMS game is packed with so much to make it unique from the others. Sims 3 still stands up to SIMS 4 and still competes with it in many ways. If you try it you'll see why. Anyway, I hope this helps someone! (Oh did I mention that every word in their language is really translatable? ""Dag Dag!"") PS never play the phone Sims. Its nothing at all like the actual game. Play here, play the full game with the crazy personalities everywhere....the phone games are okay but they dont have the same AI type SIMS, the Sims on phone games have very little personality. So to everyone the SIMS are worth a try, but you've got to know what the game is about first.. be creative and open your mind. You'll also need the cheat codes (allowed by the creators and encouraged), maybe a little of the mods (also encouraged) a few packs for spicing it up.. and an idea of what you want to create. So look it up on you-tube or watch streamers on Twitch so that you know how to go about making a really fun game for yourself!",73,2,1,"April 6, 2021"

Ingredients: 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup water 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1 pinch salt 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

76561199101721518,Sheev,"Sims 4 gave me depression Sims 4 is 81% on steam, meaning it‚Äôs less than $5. So I got it, because I had watched a Graystillplays video on how to torture Sims, and thought it would be fun. I buy it, download it, open it up, and start playing. And then the pain starts flooding in. My sim, who I made maybe 5 minutes ago, starts talking to people, making friends, and having fun. I build him a house, he gets a job, and everything is going well. I quit the game, and go about my day. The next day, I open it up again, and keep playing. About 10 minutes in, my sim, who I named ‚ÄúEva Unit-009‚Äù has a girlfriend. I joke to myself, ‚Äúis this guy speed running or something?‚Äù So I keep playing, making more money, friends, skills etc. Next thing I know, my Sim has proposed to his girlfriend, she said yes, and they get married. ‚ÄúDamn, he is speed running‚Äù I say. Fast-forward real life 2 days, and now he has a stable job, a house, kids and a wife, money, friends, and happiness. This is a certified bruh moment EA has created a game with the intent to taunt me. My sim, a cluster of 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs on a screen, has achieved what I can only dream of as I cry myself to sleep. I have friends, but they‚Äôre the kind I‚Äôve known since we were toddlers, so I have little to no skill in making new friends. I have tried to get jobs before, but this pandemic screwed me over. I have no opportunity to go out and see my city, to meet people, to feel alive. My only escape from online schoolwork is to stare another screen. This whole damn year has taken me to depths I didn‚Äôt think I go. And now, because of Sims 4, I forced myself to acknowledge it. For the first time in what feels like forever, I cried last night. I have a deep longing for fulfillment and happiness, for friends and family, but I can‚Äôt see the road to reaching it. I don‚Äôt think I need a therapist, since I have never struggled with things like this before, but I just need to get it off my chest.",52,41,1,"April 13, 2021"

DSGREESE_666,DSG_REESE666,"Finally The Sims 4 hits Steam after years of playing and getting into the Sims since I was 8 I finally have a much better platform to play on. I put 1000+ hrs into it on Origin (Don't judge me I wasn't invited to parties in HS) This game saved my life during a time where I almost gave up on life. Watching simmers videos on YouTube made me realize that The Sims is a stress relieving game for those that hate what's currently going on in the world or hate how their life is going this is a great escape from all of it. I do have a few problems with it. There's no cloud saves on either version of the game, the cloud saves are only on consoles that's my main complaint. I love The Sims series a lot and I do find the expansions worth it (only when their on sale) Humble Bundle is currently doing a sale on the game and every piece of DLC (Origin versions Only) the good thing about it however is that you can use all of those DLC with the Steam version once your link your Origin account to your Steam account. I love the fact that EA is putting their origin games on Steam (even though you'll still need Origin for some weird reason) however it does open door for millions of Steam users to play these games especially multiplayer games where some FPS games are usually dead in a year due to lack of player (CoD on Steam).",31,2,1,"July 19, 2020"

My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

76561198867696132,scribblesknight,"This game has better graphics, sure, but it has no soul. Everything that was fun about the last three Sims games is nowhere to be found in this one. The base game is woefully empty - you need mods to make it even mildly interesting. The emotions based gameplay gets repetitive and boring very quickly. And each DLC that provides minimum content (that were provided in the base game itself for previous Sims titles) is priced ridiculously high. The whole game is set up to be a cash grab. If you like building, this game is cool. If you like humour, family trees, interesting premade Sims, story progression, open world, and pretty much everything else The Sims is famous for, don't waste your time with this game.",39,0,-1,"September 27, 2021"

It's also impossible to quit. You can't get enough of it (that's how they trick you into buying the DLCs), and even if you stop playing, you will be back in a few months. If you're an experienced player, it's even harder to quit. The entire community loathes this game and are an extremely dedicated fanbase. This game is going to ruin my life and I hate it.

A lot of the packs feel like they were ideas for spin off games then they decided to put them into the main game becausee there is already an established player base for it to purchase the pack idea. A good example for this is the StrangerVille pack this just feels like a spin off game idea something akin to The Sims Medieval or The Sims Castaway. Also any other life state apart from young adult and adult don't have any if some game play at all 7 years later... The sims went from a life sim to a millennial sim, sad to say buts its true.

RensAgatha,Rens Agatha ‚Åß„Äê„É¨„É≥„Çπ„Äë,"Sims 4 has the advantage of being more stable than Sims 3. Technology improve, the less animation we got. Since both games are produced by EA, they both share the same DLC issues, but 3 is still the better game and that remains a fact! Review : About Description Art/Graphic Gotta say, it looks cartoony, but that doesn't really bother me. it has its own style, and at least it isn't using the shell shading graphics ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• used in indie games like Genshin. The style of the game brings the Sims more to life. Maybe. Color wasn't really a big deal, even though some maps that look better are hidden behind a paywall/DLC. so far, I've had no problems. Gameplay We're going to make a lot of comparisons to the previous successful game, The Sims 3. The base gameplay remains the same, but many things from sims 3 have been removed and moved to DLC, and many other things appear to have been removed by EA. When it comes to The Sims 4's base game, it stinks. It's not open world, the Sims are going to work using Uber, and we have no car, we can't even buy one, no interesting part-time job, no grocery store, and the best thing, where you can beg for money just by playing guitar on the street, is gone, along with the last no sh*t given by EA. The good thing is its more modern good animation using mods, improvement stuff from Sims 3 is using mods, and also woohoo is better using mods. The best thing about the game without mods? You've got to pay for it. See? Sims 4 is better than Sims 3 because the community has more and better mods than the entire game! Multiplayer You can download other people's creations from the library or upload your own pre-built structure to the internet. Not like The Sims Mobile or FreePlay, there is no online visit. Control I do need some time to get used to the new camera control, though. We are able to use Sims 3 controls, but I prefer to move on, so while there is no issue with the keyboard and mouse, there is an accessibility issue. keep reading.. Music or Sound Although the Sims 3 gameplay is fantastic, the Sims 2 has superior audio and music than any other the sims game. Playtime It may take around 10 hours for just the base game, and around 924 hours, according to many users using DLC or community mods will extend the length of your Sims game. Story Ah, the Sims game where you could create your own narrative and pass away after woohooing in beds, with the grim reaper, or even in straw piles. What the heck are you doing, EA? Did the dev engage in sexual activity in the straw pile? How tough is the meat there? oh my god. PC Port Tested OS Windows 10 Pro | 64 Bit, Version 22H2. Hardware AMD Ryzen 7 5700G CPU NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 8GB GPU 16 GB DDR4 RAM Performance Yeah the stupid EA game won't allow me to use MSI afterburner so I need to monitor my hardware temp by myself. Yeah the game runs fine even on highest setting. HD resolution. 60 FPS. CPU temp | reach 60¬∞C above GPU temp | 50¬∞C - 59¬∞C Note : Temp depending on your room temperature. Game Optimization Better optimization than the Sims 3. there you go Sims 4 fanboy! Rating Rated for +Everyone Can be played by everyone. Difficults level : Relaxed , Game that has simple gameplay, no competitive, only game that focuses on idling. Accessibility Audiotory / Deaf Playable for audio disability. Audio focus and audio quality are back Speaker setup mono, stereo, etc. is available Master volumes, Voice, Object music, sound effects, Music and UI sound setting are present! Colorblind / Visual No colorblind mode. No brightness control. The UI scale setting is available. There is no dark mode UI. It always uses a bright white UI. There are mods for it, but they don't work for all UIs. Motor / Body disability No control binding is supported, wtf? EA no longer challenges everything. They challenge their own graves! How many Game Bug The game won't launch because of EA's app launcher. Suddenly, the Sims are being rude to one another. A patch was made available, but it was ineffective. The same bugs from before are present in the patch. The more Sime you has in a map the more dumb they become EA alone The game version used to create this review was 1.93.129.1030. DLC/In-App purchases Well ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, I only have season that's not even worth it for its price; get in on sale above 50%. I use mods to make the game more entertaining than the entire private life of the EA employee.. Community Health & Region Price Community full of bug report and laucher problem, typical EA. Price were ass, get it on sale! The biggest clown you'll ever see is EA itself. My oppinion The Sims 5 gets leaked, I had no interested with that builder stuff, seem like the game will removed much better stuff than before! Recommended? If you admit the game was good, you smell unworthy like a cow and had no better life. Yeah its recommended for its own gameplay, yes it is. At least you can play based game for free waiting for the Sims 5 coming out. gonna play this game for awhile..

horroraddiction,Seraphel du Marquin,"The Sims 4 is the most lacking base game we got and took awhile just to get pools, ghosts, stairs that can bend and now windows that can be put on half tiles. The things they did get right this game? Create a Sim is WAY EASIER to make unique looking sims and not have them all looking like the same in game. Building is amazing in this game, it‚Äôs a lot more friendly then Sims 3 ever was because it doesn‚Äôt punish you for changing the floorplan or wanting to add a basement like the sims 3 did. That being said the sims lack that personality they had in the past games and they all start to feel the same after a generation. If you want to play base game only for a while I would say you need mods because that‚Äôs the only way you fix the dull gameplay it has to offer. Mods I would use? MC Command Center , Slice of Life, UI Cheats, Meaningful Stories, Basemental Drugs (18+), Wicked Whims (18+) and T.O.O.L if you like to build. The DLC is way too much for what they have to offer but that being said you don‚Äôt have to buy the DLC on steam. If you shop around on CD key sites and activate the code on origin, you can still use the DLC well playing the steam version. Which means another thing people hate, It launches Origin to play the game which is a turn off for most people. I would still say buy it, I picked up some DLC and i‚Äôm having a blast playing. You make your own fun in this kind of game so don‚Äôt expect it to push out a story for you. Play with life, play with sims.",22,0,1,"July 14, 2020"

I will build houses and households while I sleep, this game has literally consumed me.

TKsMantis,TKs-Mantis,"If you have the base game alone, this entry in the series may seem bland and watered down. Having spent time on the Xbox version and now the PC version of this game, I can safely say that with the DLCs, this is one of the best simulation titles available. The staggering price of the content packs at this point can be daunting, and I suggest for those of you who are not completionists to just look at add-on packs that sound like they add something interesting to the game for your playstyle or preference. Overall, The Sims 4 is highly addictive and carries the series well at this point. I have sunk many hours into the Xbox version, and playing it the right way on PC will only add many more.",39,2,1,"September 28, 2020"
76561197972557068,DadsAreBrilliant,"We do enjoy this game, Multiplayer would make this game so much more fun. EA needs to do better though, This game is now free, so Loyal players who have purchased your game and helped it grow should be rewarded with a free (Decent) DLC pack, wether this is an exclusive thank you or a voucher towards a DLC of your choosing. On the Subject of DLC, too many DLC. MANY MANY of these DLC should not be seperate. They are part of an already existing pack or should be part of the base game. Seasons - for example should be in the base game. Little Pets DLC should be part of the cats and dogs pack. I know EA doesn't read these or give a s##t about their players opinions.",48,2,-1,"September 17, 2023"
DrewconicSorc,DeidreMercerVT,"This game costs 1000 dollars. EA continues to show they care almost entirely about money by locking a vast majority of it's content behind paid DLC, and this DLC is far overpriced. Look at it this way, for 39.99 you can get BlazBlue Centralfiction, one of the best fighting games on the market, a game with 36 characters all of which are well-designed and fun to play, or you could get the ability to go to University in the Sims, a classic expansion for the series but one which pales in comparison to it's predecessor in the Sims 3. I would add that you have to buy the base game too, but after 6 years of being sold for around $20, it's finally going Free to Play, presumably because the executives at EA figure that they won't be getting any new players if they still have to pay to start the game. The game without DLC feels hollow and empty, like parts of the game were deliberately stripped away to be sold back as DLC later. The DLC is a very hard sell, to bring it back to the BlazBlue comparison, Centralfiction has one DLC, priced at 7.99 Jubei is an entire character with new mechanics, combos, and a new playstyle. EA seems to think that for 9.99 you deserve hot tubs. hot tubs. That's it, that's their 10 dollar DLC. In total the DLC contains 32 housing items, only 2 of which (the hot tubs) are functionally different than other items. It's other additions are 3 hairstyles and 9 clothing items. Obviously I don't expect for these two games to have comparable since a lot of the sims is building houses and customization, but I think these features are worth 2.99 AT BEST. It is embarrassing that EA has the nerve to charge us $10 for this. It is a bad deal, plain and simple. The game is fun, it's very well made for the most part, and I even think a some of the DLC is very good. I cannot recommend it in good concise though. It also makes you use the Origin launcher which ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• suuucccks. If you're going to buy any of this game's additional content make sure to do it while it's on sale so that you're giving EA as little money as possible.",48,3,-1,"October 19, 2022"

Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised they gave you more than 2 hairstyles. Remember, it‚Äôs EA. The Sims lost its appeal when I grew up. The Sims was great when I couldn't have my own house, couldn't get a job, get married, etc. Now, though? Why would I simulate being married and having kids when my actual wife and kids have far more depth and are far more annoying? Why simulate going to work and trying to advance my career and pay the bills when I already do that miserably for 40 hours a week? Truth is no one knows why this game is fun anymore.

76561198181307999,Clover Carmen,"I think people have said it: to ‚Äúactually play and enjoy the game to the fullest, you have to pay over $10,000 for paywall packs."" (Edit) Okay, I wrote this review a long time ago with limited packs, but now that I have unlocked over 60% of the worlds, I need to write a better review. I will still maintain my opinion when I say that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this game to people, but now I will add more as to why. The pros: Since I am a crossover fan artist and fanfic writer, I get to create my fictional anime and cartoon characters and see them interact in a unique setting. I know this may make a lot of people cringe, but at least I get to see Mavis Dracula interact with Alucard from Castlevania in a cutesy brother/sister-like relationship. I even get a lot of fanfic inspiration stories from seeing my fictional characters interact with one another. The other good thing is creating my own unique buildings and homes (best building tools if you want something fast and non-complicated) then I use them as background references for my comics & mangas. It really helps a lot and cuts down on time and work. So it‚Äôs not a total waste of my time, is what I want to say. And those are the only good things I have to say about it. Now the cons: It‚Äôs just like any Facebook game, but in 3D and with better graphics. it's very time-consuming. like it eats up your valuable time if you are an adult with responsibilities. One second you are on it, and the next thing you know, it‚Äôs nighttime, your house is a mess, your chores haven‚Äôt been done yet, and you missed work. Your sim equivalent lives the perfect life while yours gets neglected. It goes on and on and has no end. You need to schedule a time for this game, like one hour a week or so, in order not to lose track of your life. This game is like a leeching spouse that keeps draining your wallet for a promise of a better and more fun relationship, but eventually, you‚Äôll have to put it down as it‚Äôs not worth spending your money on it for the rest of your life. This game is like a drug, and you are the drug addict. You need to constantly buy new packs to have fun playing the game. Some packs have repetitive items that are just recolored, which I think is a scam. I keep telling myself that this will be the last time I waste my money on this game to pay for packs instead of saving my money for a rainy day. It‚Äôs been over 11 months since I last paid a penny for a Sims 4 pack (yay!). I already have enough. The only reason my sister and I wanted to play this game was so that we could try the wizard, werewolf, mermaid, vampire, and alien packs. I actually wrote a review on EA and suggested that they‚Äôd make Medieval Prince Charming and Medieval Maiden outfits, with fairy and mythology outfits as well, but got rejected and scorned instead. Apparently, creating new outfits to suit the many creatures‚Äô unique physics is a hassle, but repeating the same items in different colors and charging people over $20 for it is A-OK??? Packs that would come later for free as a daily login bonus had you just been more patient!!! If you want to play this game, I highly recommend that you play it for free. And if you want to spend some money on it, then the wizard, werewolf, mermaid, vampire, and alien packs are more than enough. Because there are times when they do these daily bonuses where you win the items for free instead of buying them.",55,0,-1,"April 29, 2023"

I recall the days I shared this world with my cousin, though it was but three years ago when I finally claimed the game for my own (back when coin was still required to enter its gates). Since then, it has brought me much joy and distraction. Yet, I must confess, to truly revel in the experience, I sought out custom content and mods to breathe new life into the world. That, perhaps, is the beauty of *The Sims 4*‚Äîits very essence is shaped by your hand, and the journey is as rich as you make it. There are many who craft wonders to enrich the base game with CC and mods, though, alas, the need for a few additional packs cannot be denied, for the base game is, by itself, quite meager. Indeed, its limitations can be quite stark. My hope is that EA shall continue to breathe new life into this game that has stood beside me in troubled times. I cherish the joy of creating characters, the vast freedom of customization, and the wondrous building system. Yet, the gameplay itself can grow weary, especially for those who possess only the base game. :] Thank you for reading! Here is a kitty. ‚ï±|„ÄÅ (ÀöÀé „ÄÇ7 |„ÄÅÀú„Äµ „Åò„ÅóÀç,)„Éé",21,3,1,October 12

CaelanAegana,Caelan_Aegana,"I got into the Sims really recently as a result of the pandemic and a ridiculous man inexplicably in charge of my country making everything feel completely out of control. Designing your own houses and exploring different lifestyles is fun, and is absolutely the time sink I wanted. BUT. For a game that's been out this long, there are a lot of bugs and a surprising lack of content and options. If you play it for any length of time you're going to quickly get bored with the base game. And the expansions are the cost of an entire new game for some reason. I guess that's what you get with the industry leaning more and more heavily into microtransactions (at least it's not $1/single piece of art yet...). But it makes the game feel really underdeveloped. Really you're gong to need custom content from other players to get the most out of the experience. And the brazen money-grabbingness of it all is further evidenced by the latest game pack. Look, it's a game where you micromanage stuff. It's not a grand majestic space opera. Disney and EA both need to calm down and realize that just because you have rights to an IP doesn't mean that people aren't going to get sick of it if you slap it on EVERYTHING. Cost effective or not. I mean, I can easily put the same number of hours into a nice open world RPG that already comes with all the features for way less money. The Sims 4 is only worth getting if you have the extra cash to burn. But by far the most annoying thing for me personally is I can't run it if my laptop is on battery power, because it crashes.

kazfirez,Kazfire,"It takes 97 minutes to shower. 25 minutes to make a grilled cheese, and 55 minutes to eat said grilled cheese. 5 minutes to walk from my front door to the kitchen approximately 11 squares away. For a game centered around simulated life, I'm not exactly sure what species you're attempting to simulate. I take showers in 7-15 minutes MAX, a grilled cheese takes no longer than 3 minutes to prepare, and 5 minutes to cook. I can eat the same grilled cheese in no more than 5 minutes. My apartment is almost the same layout as the one from tutorial, and it takes me no more than 30 seconds to get from the door to my kitchen... To shower, cook, and eat in Sims 4 takes approximately 4 hours when you include that massive travel time between kitchen to couch, to shower. To do the same in real life takes at max 30 minutes. I haven't played much of the Sims in the past, and it seems I have made the right choice in not purchasing it. I don't believe that anyone legitimately plays this without cheat codes to avoid wasting time at ""work"". I gave this game an honest 30 minutes, before seeing that showering took me 90+ minutes, and how long it took to eat a sandwich, and still being expected to meet other needs, a social life, and still manage to get to work. I can do all this, maintain a social life, and work 50hrs/week, and still have time left over to play shoddy EA games. Please, before you decide to make a 5th cancerous game, re-evaluate your time management system. Thanks. OH AND TO EDIT THIS REVIEW: WTF is wrong with your DLC prices??? You honestly expect over $500 USD for a series of useless items that do not contribute anything to the game itself? Seriously.

Creating families, and creating houses as well as community lots. There's one thing that irked me a bit in this title. Lots.

76561198866398362,xaustinn,"This game definitely has many flaws and issues, but despite that, I find myself having a fairly enjoyable time when playing. This game is a great way to pass time in my opinion, and if you play genuinely without using a ton of cheats, it can even feel quite rewarding. There are a lot of interesting (And at times slightly questionable) features that you can discover by playing various times and experimenting with the game, and there are of ton of things to do. There are some fun built-in cheats that are fun to mess around with, and there's a fairly good amount of customization, so you can make some pretty interesting characters for your game. Although I enjoy this game, it's just like any other game, and of course, it has flaws. I'm going to list down some of these flaws and try providing some tips on how to fix them, or just make them easier to ignore. Starting off, one of the main flaws of the game is that if you want to own everything it offers, you have to pay a very large amount of money. A lot of exciting features are only available if you pay for an expansion pack or something of the sorts, and a lot of the things that the game offers in exchange for money are considered not worth the price. A commonly used way to fix this is by downloading mods online that add new game mechanics, furniture, etc. I have never myself tried this, since I find the base game with the very few expansions I have good enough, but I've seen many people doing it and I'm sure that there are a lot of places online that state which mods they think are the best and most exciting ones. Another flaw that I've myself gotten upset over is the fact that character customization can be pretty limited. For example, I couldn't find anything close to my hairstyle in the game, and had to settle for a slightly wavy hair (For context, I have short, curly hair). The main problem with this is that many people can't make themselves accurately in the game for reasons such as the game not having their hairstyle, their facial features, etc. The most popular way to solve this is using CC (Custom content) when making sims. CC is custom content made by players that you can use in-game, and for some people, it makes a huge difference. I wouldn't necessarily consider this a flaw of the game, but people often find themselves getting bored and running out of ideas for what to do, since this game doesn't directly give you a goal or objective. An easy way to solve this is to try setting  a crazy goal for your sim and making rules to how you will achieve that goal or trying to successfully follow a storyline. Those were just examples, but there are very easy ways to prevent boredom in the sims 4. This game has many more flaws than that, but those are the main ones I've encountered. Overall, I just find this game enjoyable and think it's chaotic and rather funny, so I would recommend it.",22,0,1,"September 15, 2022"
76561199117194296,Crockett,"Why are the DLCs, which are basically needed if you don't wanna get bored quick, as expensive, if more than the base game? Good game, bad monetization. Unfortunate EA has to ruin everything it touches.",17,0,1,"May 7, 2021"

heeheehoohoofunnywizardman,Cricketwood,"I kind of wish Steam had a ""Maybe"" or ""Sort Of"" option, because Sims 4 has the POTENTIAL to be a good game, but because EA is so money-hungry it can't even be bothered to put out *barely* functional content. The Wedding Stories pack completely breaks weddings (even worse than they are in the base game), created Kits just so they could drain even more money from us (and, quite frankly, we're still being WAY too patient with EA at this point). This is definitely a pricey game, which is ironic given that's it's (now) free to play. It's over *$1000* to buy ALL of the DLC, which I'll break down for you right here: $560 for all 14 Expansion Packs (some of which include features like playable school and careers, weather, pets, and university, which you need to pay extra money for in a LIFE SIMULATOR, plus other feature such as the ability to live in cities, islands, and mountains) $240 for all 12 Game Packs, which are features like supernatural beings (werewolves, vampires, etc.), camping, restaurants, spas, the aforementioned broken Wedding Stories pack, and then the ever-shameless Journey to Batuu Star Wars tie-in. Oh, and there's another one (Strangerville) that's basically a parody of Stranger Things (shocking, I know) that lasts like a good hour or so before the story's over. $180 for all 18 Stuff Packs, which are usually just collections of furniture, clothes, and a few new gameplay features that aren't big enough to warrant being a Game Pack. One of these is My First Pet Stuff, which is infamous for being DLC for DLC, as you need to own the Cats & Dogs Expansion Pack in order to even use this one. Yeah. You can't even have a  hamster unless you pay $40 dollars extra for another, MUCH larger pack. ...and then we have the Kits. The *Kits.* These are basically just pieces of content EA purposely took out of other packs so that they could treat their (self-admittedly) overly-loyal fans like cash cows. The best examples of this are the Bust the Dust and Throwback Fit Kits, two of the first three Kits EA released (both of which I am slightly ashamed to admit I actually bought when they first came out; this was just before I realized how scummy EA truly was towards Sims fans). The content in the Bust the Dust Kit, whose whole thing was that it had functioning vacuums and would cause dust to start appearing in your Sims' house whether or not you had a vacuum in it, could've have been lumped in with the Laundry Day Stuff Pack, and the content from the Throwback Fit Kit (which is, get this; JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF RETRO ATHLETIC WEAR) could have easily, EASILY been added to the Fitness Stuff Pack (I don't think I need to explain the logic behind that one). And Kits were first launched in March of 2021, and as of writing this review, July 2023, there are 23 Kits in the Sims 4. Look back at every other category of DLC I've listed in this review. All of those have been around since the 2010's, and yet not a single one of them has hit 20 through this game's entire run, with the highest (the Stuff Packs) only hitting 18, and yet the Kits, which have only existed for like two years, have already TOPPED them and will likely continue to do so! And while yes, the Kits are only $5 each, that's gonna add up eventually, so... ...$115 for all 23 Kits. If we combine the prices for ALL of the DLC in this game, that brings us to the mind-numbing, wallet-draining total of $1,095 for EVERY SINGLE DLC in a FREE TO PLAY life simulator which, speaking from experience, is EXTREMELY empty without it! The base game is very empty, especially once you play it after buying a large amount of the DLC. Interaction between sims is boring at best to incoherent or nonexistent at worst, Clothing choices are bland, and please, PLEASE don't make me talk about how bad the skin tones were back when the game first launched. All in all, Sims 4 is just kind of...okay? You either need a LOT of DLC or a LOT of high quality custom content to make it worth playing for long periods of time, but if you're just looking for something to mess around in for a bit, then it's fine.

76561198035994974,E.Moutaire,"Beware that this game dlc's cost fortune. There are some nitpicks I have with Sims 4. Mostly about limited plots for houses and some minor botherations - like say Eco Lifestyle's ""Community Policies"" which I am almost sure they were carried over from Sims 3 or that I can't adjust lenghts of specific life stage period - like say make toddler just take 5 days like in Sims 2. Aside these, I find Sims 4 to be fun to play, you have more control over various sims, unlike in Sims 3 where playing more then one family was next to impossible. The game is also way less buggy then 3's were, and performance is night and day comparison. However character creation (sims don't look ugly like in 3's), more leniant gameplay, the general details like various mood modifiers - this game has these plenty, the overall ease of use, not restricted to just one family thus bridging gap between gameplay lost of Sims 1 and 2 to bridge burner Sims 3 .. I consider 4's a good step. Especially now visually Sims now can look truly goregous, unlike even in Sims 2. Ah and game doesn't make monsters from townies - Sims 2 generated aesthetic abominations A LOT which was proving difficult if you are for legacy challenge playing. No, I have no issue that Sims 4 isn't continuation of 1,2 and 3 in straight timeline. The only proper conclusion to whole plot of Sims was exactly like 4 - alternate 'fixed' universe to prevent 2's from happening.

shrayzzz,SHRAYZZ,"Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5) The Sims 4 continues the beloved life simulation franchise with a wealth of creative possibilities and an abundance of heartwarming moments. With its intuitive gameplay, endless customization options, and engaging social interactions, it stands as a delightful and immersive experience for players of all ages. Likes: Endless Creativity: The Sims 4 offers a remarkable level of customization, allowing players to design unique Sims, build dream homes, and shape entire neighborhoods to their heart's content. The Creative Tools empower players to unleash their imagination and bring their visions to life. Vibrant and Expressive Sims: The Sims in The Sims 4 are brimming with personality, emotions, and quirks, making them feel more alive than ever. Their interactions and reactions to various events add depth to the gameplay and storytelling. Expansive Gameplay: The game features various expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs that introduce new content, activities, and themes to enhance the overall experience. These expansions provide fresh gameplay elements to keep players engaged. Community and Sharing: The Sims 4 encourages community engagement, enabling players to share their creations and download content from other players through The Gallery. This vibrant community aspect enhances the longevity and enjoyment of the game. Dislikes: Limited Open World: Unlike its predecessor, The Sims 3, The Sims 4 features a more segmented and load-screen-based world, which may feel restrictive for players who enjoyed the seamless open world of the previous installment. DLC Costs: While the expansion packs offer exciting content, the cumulative cost of purchasing multiple DLCs can be significant, especially for players who wish to access all the game's features. In conclusion, The Sims 4 is a captivating and immersive life simulation game that allows players to play, create, and explore their virtual worlds with endless possibilities. Its emphasis on creativity, vibrant Sims, and interactive storytelling provides an enjoyable and heartfelt gaming experience. Though the segmented world and DLC costs may pose minor drawbacks for some players, the overall package is a testament to the game's enduring popularity and the devotion of its dedicated fan base. Whether you're a veteran Simmer or new to the series, The Sims 4 offers a delightful and engaging virtual life for players to immerse themselves in and build their dream societies.",20,0,1,"July 31, 2023"

76561198367742585,ToastKiller,seriously screw this game. For how expensive it is you would expect something semi good but no. The game is super choppy and everything is part of dlcs which cost an arm and a leg. Half of the game is locked until you spend 500 dollars on dlcs. Also there is no autosaving and to play you have to download other software. The game is prone to random crashes and since there is no autosaving if you dont constantly save you can lose hours of work. I played the game for 2 hours and then a random crash made me restart at square 1. Was fun the 1st time but definetly wont be fun the second time. There is barely even a tutorial and the menus are so confusing I had to spend half an hour alone just figuring out what the menus do. Dont buy unless you want to spend have your time playing saving and are ready to pay a ridiculous amount of money for dlcs. I dont reccomend this game. I wish I could get a refund for this peice of garbage but since its EA I know for a fact that I wont get one.

OK, so, it's a people simulation game. It's cute, in way. It's also clearly dated. Super bare-bones in the base game it's painfully obvious that the game allowed for extensions of gameplay with DLC, right? Right! So I check out the DLCs, seeing stuff in many respects that should have been in the base game already but weren't - some very obvious things. And then... I looked at the prices. WTF. Seriously, even with 30% discount across the board it's still way over ‚Ç¨500?... I don't know what EA is thinking here but they effectively made me turn away from such a blatant display of greed with that. DLC prices that have been kept at launch prices since 2014, even with the launch prices being stupid-high as well. So the bottom line is I won't even be buying the base game at a deep discount now because it's incomplete, and I don't plan on paying full game level prices for each DLC to just add something obvious. Or just a few new outfits. I mean: I get that adding stuff to a game takes effort, but if after 6 years you still keep the prices at launch prices you've gone way beyond getting ROI and are just milking your players for more.

I mean really, pets as an add-on is 40 dollars? you made it already and sold it already, now you're just reselling it for twice the amount.

README IF YOU HAVE THIS WITH ANY DLC ON ORIGIN: So I have an odd special review for people in the odd predicament where they already have this on Origin with a ton of the DLC already.  If you have it on Origin and you already have a collossal ass-ton of DLC on there, you can actually buy the BASE GAME here on steam, and Origin will add all the DLC.  YOU DO NOT have to buy the DLC twice if your wanting to go from Origin to Steam, only the base game.  The price of the base game has nothing against the price of all the DLC as I'm sure you may know.  As it currently stands, half my DLC is from origin and the other half is here on steam, so I know it works (you do gotta tinker a'lil).  Ignore my playtime by the way as I've played a bit on Origin. If you do do this I recommend on the sims 4 store page here on steam clicking the dropdown arrow on all the DLC you already own on Origin and click ""ignore"" which greys them out on steam to kinda indicate to yourself you already have them on Origin.  It really helps any confusion and keeps you from accidentally Double-Dipping DLC lol. As far as the game review itself goes it genuinely is a really great game but stupid stupid STUPID expensive if you want the whole package with all DLC.  While I recommend the game and DLC I also at the same time cannot in good conscience say that the price involving the DLC is AT ALL fair, not even close, not even a teeny-tiny bit.  I am honestly as appalled and disgusted by the price of the DLC as I possibly can be. It literally doesn't get worse than this, just putting that out there xD.  IF YOU MUST and are (R@zY like me for the love of GabeN wait for the DLC to go on sale as low as it can frikkin go.  If your a game collector that seeks the full package from your games then EA developers are gonna bend you over and buttfk you with an XL spiked strapon (no lube).

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",219,32,1,"December 10, 2022"

76561198090141267,They Call Him Mr. Z,"Alright, so here's the scoop: I'm a huge fan of the Sims, and, like most of the other reviewers, I've seen the evolution of Sims games. Sims 3 was absolutely phenomenal - I loved it! When Sims 4 was announced, I hopped on the hype train, ready to have a great experience. But I didn't. What a lot of people don't know, is that The Sims 4 launched missing several key features from previous installments including the removal of the ""Toddler"" life state, and the removal of family trees. Traits have been pruned into the oblivion, so with the base game you only get about 15 to choose from as opposed to the 30-40 from the base game of 3. Some of the missing features were eventually patched in after EA received a lot of backlash for it, but the game still feels empty. == Pros == *A LOT less lag than Sims 3 - my worlds don't take 15 minutes to load. *Graphics are more vibrant than they were in previous titles. *Build Mode has been greatly improved, and allows for a much better experiencing when creating homes and buildings. *Sims now have moods that affect their actions and how they interact with others - i.e. angry sims stomp around, and scared sims have the option to take a ""nervous poop"". == Cons == *One of the best and most interesting things about The Sims 3 was that the map was much more open world. Zoom out of your house and see whose visiting the local parks, the community pool, entering and exiting buildings. You could control your sims even if they're all the way across town. The Sims 4 does not let you do this. Neighborhoods are sectioned off, so each one has a loading screen when travelling between them. If you go to visit a gym in another neighborhood, you have to take control of either that sim alone at the gym, or the rest of the family back home. You can switch between whose active, but you can't control both at the same time. *A lot of furniture and items that were available in the base game of Sims 3 are now locked behind DLCs. *Several years later, I noticed bugs where I command my Sim to do something, and they just stand there, staring at nothing. This sometimes requires a restart if it goes on for too long. *You can no longer control your pets. This is one of my least favorite changes between 3 and 4. In Sims 3, you had the ability to control your pets. *There's a lot less life states to play as in this game - 3 had pixies, witches, werewolves, vampires, and genies which all had their own unique wishes, lifestyles, and gameplay elements. *You can no longer create custom patterns or choose colors from a color wheel when in Create-a-Sim, or when placing furniture. You are bound to whatever choices of colors there are by default. This absolutely murdered creativity. The Sims 4, although I enjoy playing it and creating Sims and homes, is a shell of it's former self. Do yourselves a favor, only buy this game when it's on sale, especially the DLC. There's over $1000 worth of DLC now, with some of the DLC costing as much as the game itself, if not more. EA should be ashamed of their business models in nearly every game they've released in the past 10 years. Disgraceful.",18,0,-1,"June 16, 2021"
76561198299203125,Winter,"Ok, so, sims 4 base game. I never played any of the older franchise. I just dive right onto the latest , i've had this first on console but switched to pc instead :D  .I can say that it's fun specially now that, First- it can drop its price at a friggin 88% off when sale, (i bought it on full price back then btw, both on console and pc). Second- Now, this year, surprisingly has been very interesting and- enjoyable i must admit. Aside from the dlcs always on sale ,(but still pricey), they are constantly adding something new to the base game. And now with the new update that adds more realism? I mean, before, your sims LIFE is like so perfect with just little moodlets to let them down, and everything is just so perfectly boring and it lacks more interaction and stuff like u know, gameplay? I mostly just spend time on build mode. Now with their new update, neighbors can have their own stories and drama-YOUR household CAN have more drama, and it can be a total mess! (happened to me apparently) Its just small autonomy stuff and you're totally in control if you dont want it,but it added more life to the game! And of course the new sim delivery, new scenario(which i never tried), and basically new gameplay. They added more color swatches last year to some base game outfits and to some build items as well. (maxis have been quite active this past year) there is so much going on now that i have to spend more time on live mode than i ever did. Maybe thats why im posting a review just now. i'm always finding something new lately on cas or build mode. they keep updating the game to make it more immersive than it used to be. and i appreciate that. BUT of course it will be much more fun when you add some of its DLC :) ps: i only buy dlc when its on sale, cause even in 50% off-its still a bit pricey alright. Anyway, i just hope EA continue to add more good stuff to the base game. Peace... ;)",14,0,1,"March 28, 2022"

Furqie,Furq,"After the unapologetically bugged Sims 3, I honestly thought it couldn't get worse with Sims 4, but EA has not failed to surprise. Actually I let EA surprise me despite my better judgment. This garbage was released in 2014, and so little work obviously went into polishing and straightening out. 1 minute in: The end of first day. He goes to bed. I thought he would wake up when he was fully rested or something and intentionally didn't force him to wake up, I let him sleep as long as he wanted. A little too much couldn't hurt. He sleeps for about 20 hours straight and consequently woke up famished and immediately peed himself. 10 minutes in: I make him wake up (of course). He does wake up (good for EA), but the sleep icon bottom-left doesn't go away. It just stays there. I can do other things, but it just won't go away. OK. Whatever. EA after all. What did I expect? Then I do some stuff, days pass: It stays there. Doesn't cause any inconvenience other than the impression it gives that EA doesn't disappoint. OK. Whatever. 25 minutes in: Now another icon gets stuck there right on top of the sleep icon. Again it doesn't affect the gameplay. I'll let it slide this time, too. 30 minutes in: Next day. He eats. I order him to clean up his plate. The icon disappears about a second after it looks like he's going to do it. Then he just stops. Minds his business. Clean up the plate, please? Again the same thing. He won't do it. OK. Whatever. I can place the darn plate in the trash myself. Problem solved, right? Bunch of hours in: The stuck icons go away when I save and exit. Maybe that has to do with him not doing what I told him to do. I can just save and exit every time the icon gets stuck. The two bugs turn out to be unrelated. No activity icons are stuck, but he still persistently won't  clean up his plate OR take out the trash. Or rather, he takes the trash and drops it before leaving the house EVERY SINGLE TIME. Hmm. OK.. 6 hours in: Certain actions randomly become undoable just whenever. It would be tolerable perhaps if this bug was limited to minor actions like cleaning up, but now he won't go to work. I spent half an hour trying to make him go to work. Saved and exited multiple times. Nothing works. Finally: I start a new game. Maybe something was wrong with the previous one. A car was stuck somewhere in town? A fish tried to hop out of the water but couldn't so the game understandably had to go haywire? The usual Sims 3 circus shenanigans could be happening and breaking the game. I start a new game. My sim goes to bed at the end of the day. I let him sleep until the bar is fully green, and I tell him to wake up in the morning. 3 hours until his shift. We got stuff to do before that. He won't wake up. I break the wake up command. He sleeps like a baby. He has been sleeping now for close to 2 days, and I guess he's about to die peacefully in his sleep. Soon he'll be out of his misery at least. EA, my dears. You deliievered a most fantastical disappointment. I honestly didn't think you guys could outdo yourselves in the embarrasment department. Bye forever.

mattesh,JRex,"At this point I am PISSED. The game is free by now, which is nice, but the DLCs are just WAY overpriced. Recently there have been some updates instead of only adding new and expensive DLCs, which in theory sounds nice. However, the recent updates have just included loads of bugs imo (fe: My Infant doesn't sleep in its crib but is glued to their caretakers feet and slides over the floor while sleeping. This one is still kinda funny cause it doesn't really interrupt the gameplay, but after about an hour of playing and changing between build-mode and live-mode the game just freezes and i have to start over (yes I have uninstalled all mods and deleted & reinstalles the game). Theres also the general frustration with updates contents: Why would i want an infant sim? Its just a toddler that cannot do anything (yeah i guess realism but theres SO much they could've added so why?) Could've just made it a free DLC instead so everyone who wants it can install it and everyone who doesnt isn't forced to. Also whats with the Infants positions in the clothes changing menu? I can't even see half the clothes and If you select pants they just point their booties at u which is kinda weird and like i wanna style an outfit, not only their bum). Imo EA is just trying to farm as much money as they can from Sims (which btw is not a new problem, as u can see it in sims 3 aswell). That is really sad cause in theory, it would be a great game but all the money grabbing is just making me feel really frustrated. TLDR: DLCs are expensive af, recent updates have been more annoying than helpful/ nice. Imo EA is just trying to farm as much money as they can from Sims, but recently noticed that people are getting more and more annoyed so they drop useless updates to make some people happy.",16,0,-1,"March 18, 2023"

I know I will be enjoying myself and run into something game breaking. Look, I have been playing The Sims religiously since Sims 1, buying all the expansions. Been playing this series religiously since I was a teenager well into adulthood. Sims 1. Sims 2. Sims 3. And all the little expansions. While the games could always get buggy and weird I had faith that the developers would work it out. The Sims 4 is unplayable for me at times. In fact, back in November of last year (2021) it became COMPLETELY unplayable, with Sims freezing and doing nothing. This happens too often. TOO OFTEN!!! I can't enjoy this game anymore!!!!

AugustusRomanus,The Sommelier,"Since going free to play, the Sims 4 is a semi decent free game. As someone who bought the game and paid for multiple DLCS, ill let you know that this game is the most stripped down and bare Sims to date. I've even played sim city with its horrible origin integration of always having to be online, and can honestly say that I had a more enjoyable experience. (Sims 4 requires Origin also, mad wack) The game honestly lacks any real soul from the earlier titles and the only thing it has a edge over the others is it's graphics, and with Sims 5 recently being announced i can only imagine that it will be the same engine as this one with just more ""interesting DLCS"" at 20$ a piece. If you want a life sim, get Sims 3 and all of those DLC's. Atleast then you'll have a game with a community that has been trouble shooting Ea's abysmal coding for over a decade. Any mod you could imagine or bug you could encounter has either a fix or work around. Even the slow loading time in Create-a-Sim have been thoroughly optimised to load in under 5 seconds with minimal lag, even on my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-box of a computer. If you like life simulators, go for something with charm or non-reptilian developers and not this barbie human simulator.

thedardanitan,Dari,"IMPORTANT: THE SIMS 4 BASE GAME IS BECOMING FREE TO PLAY ON OCTOBER 18. (THE DLC WILL STILL BE PAID) THE ONLY COMPENSATION YOU GET FOR BUYING THE GAME RIGHT NOW IS A $5 KIT GIVEN FOR FREE. IF YOU ASK ME, ITS NOT WORTH BUYING AT ALL (ALSO A SLAP ON THE FACE OF FELLOW SIMMERS WHO BOUGHT THE GAME FOR 40 BUCKS) . JUST WAIT FOR THE GAME TO BECOME FREE, AND INSTEAD USE YOUR MONEY ON AN EXPANSION PACK. Sims 4 is a good game, but it doesn't stand out very well compared to it's predecessors. Sure, it's pretty great it in it's own ways, it allows some level of multi-tasking, Sims becoming more expressful, it's attractive cartoonish art style, however, it's unfair DLC pricing and cut content from the previous games, including handful of animations is very disappointing. Has it improved from launch? Quite a lot. Is it worth playing without DLC? You could, but consider mods and custom content. Base game can easily get you bored, but it can give you hours of fun if you focus on completing milestones such as different aspirations and careers. I wish there was more to the base game, but even the smallest things, such as a video game console or a washing machine, are locked behind DLC paywalls. Do I recommend? Yeah sure, give it a try. I'm mostly a Sims 3 person, but I recently brought Sims 4 and it is pretty decent, have me couple of hours of fun. Tip: consider getting expansions and a few game packs only, leave the stuff packs and instead get free mods/ custom content ones....there are a huge library of good modded stuff packs available over the internet. Just a friendly tip to save your money. Edit: I made a guide/list of Mods and custom content packs I use, which you can view here: A Guide to the best Sims 4 mod stuff packs A Guide for The Sims‚Ñ¢ 4 By: Dari A guide to showcase some quality custom stuff packs, containing furniture and unique items for Sims houses and rooms.

I've only purchased the base game at a $20 discounted rate and am content with it, but what they are attempting with their $1000 DLC bundle at full price is criminal.  This game was released in September of 2014, six years ago.  It is trying to plumb $1020 from its fanbase for what is at most $120 worth of content.  Compared to Sims 3, it under delivers.  Take the Pets expansion for example; in Sim 3 you can have dogs, cats, horses, even a unicorn that could be sent out to burn down the houses of your enemies (not even joking.)  Sims 4, on the other hand, provides a ""cats and dogs"" expansion that simply includes cats and dogs...  Or take the Halloween themed content; in Sims 3, you could not only be a vampire, but a werewolf, fairy, a witch, wizard, or ghost.  Sims 4?  Vampires... and vampires alone is the whole expansion. Yet, in the end, neither of these titles are worth the price they are asking, especially when there are current developers in the indie circuit that far outclass the quality and quantity EA and Maxis have reduced themselves to.

76561198851912436,Witos≈Çaw,"What have you done with this game! I was a typical gamer who played variety games, including The Sims. I started this series with ""The Sims 2 Castaway"" on PSP, then ""The Sims 2"" also on PSP, then ""The Sims Medieval"" on PC, and finally ""The Sims 4"" at the premiere and as a typical gamer, I was preparing for expansions for this game, but I didn't expect how much it would cost me! I didn't know what a past this series had! I bought Expansion packs, Game packs and Stuff packs. I spent a lot of money to make this game as rich as possible, I didn't know it was a trap set by greedy EA. When I discovered Stardew Valley, I played The Sims 4 less and less, and when I heard there would be ""Kits"" for $5, I said ENOUGH! So little content for so much money is absurd, so I abandoned this game! And after a few years I came, to say how terrible EA is as a publisher for this series. Maybe let's start with this: what do I think about this game? It can be considered a ""Cozy Life"" game - we have an advanced character creator and lots of activities for our character, but there are also things that I don't like. The game is point-and-click type, so we have very limited control over our character and have to wait for him to do something or go from point A to point B (Sometimes you have to wait a very long time), but it is not everything. Why does our character learn skills too quickly? Why does our character earn too much money too quickly? Why does our character make friends with NPCs too quickly? Why are the best things so cheap? Maybe this game isn't for me anymore because it's the type of game where you can control more than one character. I rated this game negatively and not because this game is no longer for me, but because of what EA has done with this series! In the fourth part we didn't get a lot of things that came from the third part, and these mega annoying DLCs and microtransactions cost so much that you can buy several indie games! The Sims series was good in the beginning, and EA was also a good game publisher.After the success of ""The Sims"" this is where the real fun began, as spin-offs of this game were created, such as ""The Urbz"", ""The Sims Bustin' Out"" and console versions. Soon after, we got ""The Sims 2"", which one was better and in addition, we got even more spin-offs on console versions. I remember having a lot of fun with ""The Sims 2 Castaway"" on PSP. After ""The Sims 2"" came the even better ""The Sims 3"", this time not only on PC, but also on all previously available consoles. Even on old mobile phones and Nintendo DS. It is worth adding ""The Sims Medieval"", which is also a spin-off and which, apart from the PC, was also released on mobile phones and smartphones. Those were the times when it was really fun to play (unfortunately, I didn't know about all versions of the game), until ""The Sims 4"" came along and EA's stupidity. ""The Sims 4"" was graphically nice, but had much less content at launch. Additionally, we received DLC and microtransactions with little content for a high price. But the worst was yet to come.  EA has decided to withdraw all console games from online stores. However, the worst was with smartphone games - for Android we got ""The Sims 3"" and a nasty version of ""The Sims FreePlay"". And here EA did something that could be considered inexcusable! He removed ""The Sims 3"" on Android AND released ""The Sims Mobile""! Both of these games keep the player waiting, but ""The Sims Mobile"" is a real evil! It causes FOMO in players, which leads to ADDICTION! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!!! Why do you stubbornly support ""The Sims 4"" and ""Mobile"". Why are there no spin-offs of this game! Why is ""The Sims 4"" free and ""The Sims 3"" isn't free?! What happened to ""The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection""? It was free in your store and now it's gone? Greed has consumed you? Because it looks like it! Now I noticed that ""The Sims 4"", ""The Sims Freeplay"", ""The Sims Mobile"" are games created specifically to make as much money as possible for EA! I'm really disappointed with the direction this series is going! EA's greed and laziness should anger gamers. I'm horrified that so many players are playing this game and it has very positive reviews! I think this is the worst Cozy Life game. If you are reading this, avoid these games! Unless you're very resistant to expensive DLC and annoying microtransactions.",19,0,-1,June 4

LTZR,Louts,"Pretty good game honestly, but it's not on par with it's predecessor; The Sims 3. It is a huge improvement graphically but without DLC or Mod packs, The Sims 4 is basically a 5/10. A lot of things you could do in TS3 base game is considered DLC in TS4, which you have to pay for mind you. Unfortunately or fortunately TS4 went Free To Play to encourage people to buy DLC. ""Oh I got this game for free, might as well buy a few of the $1,284.19 worth of DLC."" and for people who already paid for the base game, (On Origin/Steam release) we didn't get anything it really feels like a slap in the face from EA.  Which it's EA, one of the most greediest publishers on par with ActiVision. Fun Fact: Electronic Arts (EA), has been voted as the worst company several years in a row! Even without buying any DLC I think you can get a decent amount of content in TS4 (without mods). To expand without purchasing anything, you'll need to install some mods. Rumor is The Sims 5 is in development and I really hope they go above and beyond TS3, and TS4. As there are new life sims coming out this year and the next, Paralives, Inzoi. (Paralives is a passion project, and Inzoi is a realistic looking sims on steroids made by an AAA company.) So in conclusion I do recommend The Sims 4.

I had a ton of fun playing this game alone, or with my loved ones, it's a great experience if you just want to mess around and do stupid ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. But as I said before, the whole DLC thing in Sims 4 is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• insane. In some countries, you could buy or rent a house for that much money. These DLCs are so numerous and overpriced, it should be illegal. The worst part is that without these DLCs, the main game is just a wasteland, there is stuff to do, but after a while, you just get bored. And EA creates these money laundering schemes called ""DLC"" to lure you in when that boredom hits. This game is the best example to show EA's greed and lack of passion towards gaming.

Now it would be one thing if that was in game currency; I've seen people spend that much before on games.  Hell I think I may have spent around that much collectively on Warframe back when I used to play it on PS4 (mostly for cosmetics admittedly).  But these packs are for things that feel like they should be in the base game to begin with.  Imagine paying 1500US$ for what should basically be the base game.  The only reason I own this game with a dlc pack or two is because my younger sister gave me the money to get it, and she's been the main person to play it.  I do like simulation and sandbox games, but I hate supporting developers with downright scummy business practices.  Like, do they seriously wonder why so many people pirate sims games?

batsfine,Batsfine,"It's a lot of fun! I'd recommend waiting until there's a sale for the expansions and other packs. I plan on buying a couple more expansions on the next sale. I wish the Sims 4 had more active careers overall. I don't think the base game has any. The base game itself feels barren. I'd seriously recommend buying at least one expansion pack with it. I'll give a quick rundown of the ones I have at the moment. Seasons: this is the most popular pack for some reason. You get different holidays throughout the year, temperature affects, seasonal clothing, and some other stuff. I recommend checking out the store page to see if you like it, because it really isn't my thing. Snowy Escape: has new activities like rock climbing and skiing. You get a new snowy, Japanese-themed world to visit. My favourite part of the pack is the build/buy mode items. I turned my kitchen into a tea house! Get to Work: I've had the most fun with this, by far. I've only explored one career, but I'm excited to try the others. The Detective career is too much fun. I sent my sim out on patrol for her first day, she ran into one of her friends who beat her up. She issued them a citation on the spot. I love going out to crime scenes, getting evidence, going back to the station to analyse it. Don't even get me started on interrogations. I'll just say they're hilarious. You can also work as a doctor and a scientist. These are active jobs, so you can go to work with your sims. It's much better than waiting for their shift to end. You can also run your own retail business, but I haven't checked that out yet. Cats and Dogs: you get another active career, you can play as a vet and help sick animals! While I haven't dived too far into this pack, I am happy to say that you can have raccoons and foxes as pets! I enjoy setting up rooms for them, as well as obstacle courses outside. I believe you also get another world for this too. Get Together: I do not understand why so many reviewers don't care for this one. You get a beautiful, European-inspired town and the ability to make clubs. I didn't think much of the clubs until I made one. Once you've made your club, you can decide on what activities you want your club to do -and there's A LOT of options. The best part? Those activities are not set in stone. When I feel like meeting up with my club at the gym, I can remove activities to add in working out and yoga. If I feel like meeting up at a nightclub, I can swap out anything I want for dancing, DJing, drinking and eating. The best part about clubs? You earn points from each gathering to buy a variety of perks. You can decide whether your club has a bad rep, neutral, or good reputation. You can buy perks that allow you to increase certain skill gains from activities faster. You can also buy points to set the club 'vibe' -which is how the whole group feels. So let's say you want to send your club to the gym, you can set the club vibe to energized. If you want to boost your comedy skills, you can set the club vibe to playful. Here's a tip, you can change club vibes by talking to a sim in your club, going to club > set club vibe and select what you want. I seriously love this expansion. City Living: I don't know how I feel about this one. I like the new world they added. It has cute little kareoke bars and lounges, as well as hosting several festivals throughout the year. The create a sim options have more cultural diversity (I think that's my favourite part), If you're into it, you can live in an apartment within the world. I hate to say it, but I think this is the least impressive expansion. The aesthetic is beautiful, but it feels like there should be more to do in a city. Hopefully this helps you. I know the pages will give you a better idea of what you're getting into, but then again, some of them can be vague. I think on the next sale, I'll be buying Island Living or Get Famous.",8,0,1,"August 20, 2021"

First off I have around 400 hours on the sims 4 and I have about 17 of the DLC's which btw the DLCs really help improve the game. I  also use MC mod which is also a must have if anyone wants to get a better experience with the game. I have been playing the sims franchise since Sims 2 on the ps2. Sims 2 castaway was my favorite, I personally thought the sims 3 was better than the sims 4 for the longest time however now with all these DLC's i think the sims 4 is better than the sims 3. it has a lot of customization and it really lets you do a lot with the building selection. I have been playing the sims 4 since 2014 i believe and it's been fun granted the dlc's are pretty expensive but if you wait for a sale its well worth it. My only main problem with the sims 4 is that you still cant do co op natively ... like i really dont understand why that was taken away ... sims 2 will always be the best sims for that reason but sims 4 is a good sims entry in the franchise i recommend this for anyone that wants to play a sim game.",23,5,1,"October 31, 2021"

If you answered no, you're correct. I understand why but there should still be a way to access dlc you've already paid for across platforms, the fact there isn't seems really money hungry, especially considering the price. Seriously though the base game is dry, just play the sims 3, and when EA finally thinks of way to improve it they slap a $40-$60 AUD price tag on it, and provide the smallest amount of content and MAYBE a fully functioning gameplay feature, they expect you to praise them for the grace of news skills and you're more likely to get more bugs then quality of life updates. The base game is basically a trap to get you to buy the dlc, it doesn't completely suck. it has just enough to drip you potential every now and then, to keep you playing long enough to want more, and then you grab a dlc on sale (only get them on sale if you're buying any of them), and the process starts again until the sunk cost fallacy kicks in and keeps you around.

76561198220391376,tpncis,"The worst aspect of the Sims 4 is the fact that Sims 2 and 3 existed and were so beautifully done. The Sims 4 is classic EA - limiting base game and forcing you to get expansion packs to make the game remotely worth playing. Even then, at least the Sims 2 and 3's expansions were supplementary/complementary. There was so much content in the former editions that purchasing an expansion seemed like you were buying a whole other game, Yet, Sims 4 is just a weak rehashing of the Sims 2 and 3. Several bugs, missed opportunities, removed features, small maps, loading screens, superficial and limited game play, etc, etc. The advertisements for Sims 4 promoted ""you rule"" yet there are very few instances in which players have full control/rule over the game. It's sad that such an amazing series has come to this (i.e., reproducing Sims 2 and 3 in a much weaker format and expensive expansions).

Another annoying thing, platforms that force users into using it by buying up games (ahem EPIC.. ahem). When The Sims 4 hit the Steam marketplace it was no big decision, I knew I had to buy it. Steam is my one and only launcher. Unfortunately you are not buying The Sims 4 on Steam, instead you are just buying an Origin code for the game which is activated when you first launch the game. It's basically just the Origin game, so now I've got 2 versions The Sims 4 on Origin. The only benefit is Trading Cards and having the game on your Steam profile, also you can buy it for cheap on Sale, thanks GabeN.

GachaPawn,Toom,"Ignore the playtime. I've got probably over a thousand hours logged, and most of the expansion content. I don't mind that they make a lot of packs. I think that's actually nice because it provides a way to feasibly expand content regulardly. However, I do take exception to a lot of other decisions the company makes. Below are just a few. First, using a pre-existing game to move to free-to-play was not a considerate move for the current player base. This was something I sorta saw coming for a while when they started introducing Kits. In fact, in Sims 1, I discovered the team had been looking into microtransactions for the sims other than full EPs. This is likely just the beginning of such a transition, and the quality will likely decrease over time as a result. Second, even with full EPs in existence, the team often released content patches that didn't undergo enough testing and wind up breaking a different paid expansion. Just a few months ago, I discovered that one of the features in the Get to Work pack was broken and had been for months, I just hadn't used it. This isn't an issue that requires mods to reproduce either. Third, the consideration at large for the player base seems to be non existent. The Build Your Own Bundle has been unavailable for over three months for several of the more recent packs, and the team has not made any public communications regarding this. They have no ETA for a fix, and this is not the first time this has occurred. There's been several times in the past where they simply did not include new packs for many many months. Their official stance in the past has always been ""about a month"". If it is in fact something they plan to fix, it needs to be better communicated to the player base. I really hope we see more competitors for the Sims franchise in the future, because its uniqueness seems to be its primary draw.",12,0,-1,"October 20, 2022"

76561198341540252,Azinette,"I've played the previous two sims games. The Sims 4 is an improvement on previous games in that the Sims can have different walks and their aspirations can change. You can travel with your Sims to work and this opens a new world. It is, however, a downgrade from Sims 3. The game isn't open world like Sims 3 and information isn't readily available. Your Sims can travel by using the phone, whereas you could previously walk, ride a bicycle or drive to your destination, in Sim 3. Things like grocery and book stores aren't readily available in the map. Which means you can either pay for items as you make them or try grow the ingredients yourself. CAS is quite limited. The colours available for outfits are set so you won't be able to amek/save any custom colours that look better on your Sim. This also applies to the furniture and decorations such as rugs. The game is still addictive, but I find myself comparing Sims 4 to Sims 3 quite often during gameplay. The improvements made in Sims 4 do not outweigh the setbacks in Sims 4.",15,0,-1,"June 26, 2021"

They think you're really adding to our game play? I paid for the sims when it was 39.99, now the base game is free because all of the actual content is DLC. DLC that is locked behind a HUUUUUUGE paywall for content that was included in SIms 1, 2 and 3. You think that this DLC is acceptable? The game doesnt even work. I cant play my game without it crashing, freezing, sims t posing, sims simply not obeying assigned tasks and choosing their own, etc. Countless game files lost over the years. I dont play with custom content or mods and my game has continuously had MAJOR issues since the game was released. This is unacceptable. The base game is broken and dont even get me started on the broken, uncompleted $expensive$ dlc that gives you barely any content, for the price of a FULL game. The base game and all DLC is broken and overpriced NEVER BUY ANYTHING FULL PRICE IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. If you havent, take a look as what the base game of sims 1 ,2 and 3 includes, you will be blown away by the amount of love, detail and pride they poured into those games to make the next even better than the last. During sims 3 is when EA got even more greedy, micro transactions and less focused on creating a game that can be a supported and loved by fans for generations. Im really disgusted and annoyed by the gaming community lately. Putting in less and less effort, we have to demand more. I dont want to support a company that continues to put out broken DLC while the base game and previous DLC's dont work properly! If we dont force these billion dollar companies to do better they will just take advantage of their fans, trying to profit off of us as much as possible. Where is the love and passion that gaming companies originally strove for? Get the game or DLC on sale if you really want to try it out. It is really not worth your money.

But, like I said, it's obvious even from the get-go that there is hardly any content. I'd recommend Sims 3, even without mods or custom content.",8,0,-1,"October 20, 2022"
mightylink,Mightylink,"This is still not as good as The Sims 3, it's lacking so many features like the open world and create a style. I did a literal face palm when I saw the price of all the dlc's on the steam store, over $1400 to get a lot of things that used to be much cheaper in previous games. They split older expansions up into new more expensive expansions like Supernatural, it's now 4 different expansions which costs $135 to get the same amount of content as before. The neighborhoods are much smaller, with only 4 or 5 lots per map, it feels like a huge downgrade all the way back to The Sims 1 again. I honestly can't recommend this game for this price, there is no good way to buy this game, not even the Deluxe edition comes bundled with any dlc's. It would of been nice to get a more complete package for $60 especially 8 years later... The only positive thing I can say about it is that it's nice all the custom content is in game now, much like the browser from Spore, it's great to be able to just plop down a custom sim or lot without having to download and copy over files.

LupinAi,LupinAi,"I've been a long time Sims fan, I remember playing one of them on my DS as a kid and begging to buy Sims 3 pets. Straight up, Sims 3 was way better than this. If you're going to buy Sims, get Sims 3 and don't waste all your money on this. I can't remember all the negatives about this game so I'll have to come back to update this review at some point. Pros: - The newest version of Sims and is getting updates and new content released - Sims are more emotive(?) - More customisation with a Sims body with a click and drag style. - Better graphics/smoother. This may be due to the lack of open world/free-roaming but that's also a con. - Mermaids look better in the 'Island living' DLC Cons: - Too many DLCs, most are quick cash grabs. They're expensive and useless, adding little to nothing to the base game. I can bet that a good chunk of comments one any new DLC release post is just people booing and mouthing off at the developers. You can't control yours pets in the pets DLC, there's no horses there either (I miss unicorns). The Supernatural DLCs (yes there's more than one if you want the full Sims 4 supernatural experience) has significantly less content than the one from Sims 3. Why are there around three DLCs for life stages (child, teen and young adult) ? I feel that a lot of DLCs could have been combined or been worked on more. It all feels half done. - Less personality traits. It's so bare. - No open world/free-roaming, travelling between lots is annoying. This means no cars and bikes too. - Custom colours/colour wheel and textures were removed in create a sim. - Mods are required just to make the game better (thank the community for that) - Whims are a little messed up. You can't 'cancel' them, only pin. I know I compare Sims 4 to Sims 3 a lot but it's really telling when the previous game was better than the current one. Sims 5 better exceed the lower expectations that the community have.",11,0,-1,"February 9, 2023"
76561199012813848,dovahkiin1652,"I want to start this by saying I grew up with both of these games (at around the same time), so they hold the same sentimental value to me and I am not trying to be biased, rather proving how much different EA has become when caring about their games and using more paywalls. I started by playing the Sims 3 as I couldn‚Äôt find the Sims 4 on Steam (I was young, and was willing to take any sort of Sims game as I was excited to play). After playing it for many hours, I bought the Sims 4. For both of them, I bought a few packs (with the game): Sims 3: seasons, generations, pets. | Sims 4: cats and dogs, parenthood, seasons Playing the Sims 3 with three packs was enough for hundreds of hours of content. Buying the supernatural pack had just as much content as one of the other packs and was much more than sufficient to play many games. Playing the Sims 4, however, felt much different. Playing the Sims 4 with three packs (which were worth the game at the time) felt like a whole bunch of nothing. It was missing the fun, the goofiness, and the soul that the Sims 3 had. The Sims 3 had much more, even when it came down to small gameplay mechanics. Cars, grocery shopping, visible schools and other public places, functional and lively parks, enjoyable holidays, lively cities, traits that implemented interesting gameplay mechanics, interesting moodlets, imaginary friends, backyard entertainment (such as treehouses), and much much more that I don‚Äôt think I have enough characters to write down. For the Sims 4, much of that needs mods or other game packs, and both options don‚Äôt even work half of the time. Even the Sims 3‚Äôs soundtrack sounds much more lively, leaving room for the player to think about how and what part of the game they want to discover and enjoy. I‚Äôm not saying the Sims 4‚Äôs soundtrack isn‚Äôt good, as I feel Ilan Eshkeri captured some of the franchise‚Äôs essence, however, it still feels much more like a paywall or just a huge loading screen rather than music for a game such as the Sims. It isn‚Äôt as lively, and not all of the DLC music fits together. Like Vampires - I understand it is supposed to be seen as creepy, but the gameplay should be focusing more on that aspect, not the music. The Sims 3 Supernatural didn‚Äôt add more ‚Äòcreepy‚Äô music, instead, it found that vibe in the gameplay. The scariest thing about the Sims 4 Vampires Pack is the music and terrible clothing/hair/facial customizable options for your sims, whilst Supernatural delves deeper into the gameplay and feels more fleshed out. While it didn‚Äôt bring as much creepy music, it did bring us the song Consuming Time which is just as good, and fits the vibe for the whole game itself. The music for the DLCs in the Sims 4 feels much more pack-based, rather than focusing on the whole game‚Äôs vibe itself, making the vibe of the whole game all over the place, and scrambled. It had more use when it came to knowing the phases of the moon, researching vampires, PLAYING as vampires, or any of the other options that the DLC added (witches, wizards, werewolves, fairies). Each was unique, having much more interesting interactions than Vampires, Werewolves, and Realm of Magic combined. That is another thing I want to add is the fact that the Sims 4 has so many separated packs, when the Sims 3 had Werewolves, Realm of Magic, and Vampires combined, and did not cost as much as the game. The same thing goes for the Sims 3 Pets versus the Sims 4 Dogs and Cats, My First Pet Stuff, and Horse Ranch. Sims 3 Pets has all those options all in one DLC, less than the game, and actually works and has sufficient content (all three of those are missing one or the other, Dogs and Cats and My First Pet Stuff being boring/a whole lot of nothing while Horse Ranch is literally just broken). The fact that many of the packs can still cost up to 50 dollars for broken, separated gameplay with only one of the advertised products in the game is so disappointing. I understand the Sims 3 used to be 40 dollars, but it also has so much more to offer compared to the Sims 4, even in base-game. It‚Äôs actually playable by itself. Although the Sims 4 is now free, I still wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to any first-time players. Yes, the Sims 3 is older and can have some problems (such as glitching when you try to open it, having sensitivity problems), but it still is a much better starting place than the Sims 4. The only people who would want to play the Sims 4 either don‚Äôt know how boring the game is unless you buy hundreds of dollars worth of DLCs or are seasoned players hoping that someday this game will be good. I have spent well over 500 dollars into this game and it still isn‚Äôt playable. Playing thousands of hours of the Sims 3 and then finally saving up enough to buy this one was such a disappointment. The DLCs for the Sims used to add so much and certainly weren‚Äôt the same as the game itself. EA has done this sort of thing recently, whether it be with the Sims, Fortnite, Madden, FIFA, etc (in which I have had experience with all games listed) have had some sort of microtransactions. The games often feel incomplete (or versions of the game, in cases such as Fortnite) and are either missing the ‚Äòpizzazz‚Äô so to speak of the last game or have become unenjoyable. For a seven-year-old game, you would expect the DLCs to be enjoyable, and actually add stuff to the game, and work half the time. But even the newest releases have problems, such as; Party Essentials Kit, For Rent, Wedding Stories, Dream Home Decorater, Backyard Stuff, Vintage Glamour, Bowling Night, ect ect (some of those aren‚Äôt new, but you get my point, only half of them work, and most of them add like two items to the game). I understand most of the packs listed are only around 5 dollars, but why even make them that much? Why can‚Äôt you just add them to the game to begin with, making it a little bit more enjoyable and worth anything? It has been very hard for me to get even an hour out of this game at a time, and trying to squeeze out as much content as this game offers has proven difficult and frustrating. I had to actively work to find stuff to do in this version, completely unlike the Sims 3. Even the pre-set households in the Sims 3 felt more interesting than anything in the Sims 4. I tried building cities, families, and storylines in the Sims 4 and it just felt so forced. That is yet another problem with EA and the Sims franchise recently; EA only cares about the money they receive from this game, and does not care about the quality of the products they are selling for it. All the DLCs for this game add up to over 1,000 dollars. Half of them don‚Äôt work. It is upsetting to see a game franchise devolve in quality and have the creators only care about the profit. If EA actually cared for this game, listened to even half of the critics, and fixed these problems it would make them so much more money. Who knew - that making an enjoyable game would appease players? Hopefully (yet unlikely), EA will turn this game around and make it more enjoyable like its predecessors, or make the next game in this series an improvement to the dumpster fire we have now. All in all, the Sims 3 (or even Sims 2, for that matter) is much more enjoyable, and I would consider spending my money on that game before spending any sort of time playing this one. It is so much more fleshed out and detailed in so many more ways and is overall just a better game. For a franchise so meaningful to people, with a record of being enjoyable for years on end from each installment, I am extremely disappointed in how this game has turned out.",12,0,-1,June 26

76561199050973831,Lachrymose Lilac,"I love the Sims and have many good memories of playing it. Before I had my own Steam account, I constantly used my dad's PC to play the game. However, I can see how nostalgia blinded me to liking the Sims 4 over time. It lacks innovation or creativity, details are choppy, and you will play for an hour or so until you quit. First of all, the need for more innovation and creativity is apparent. It quickly shows in how they force you to pay for simple aspects of life such as weather, animals, and even weddings (now, at least, lol). Even when allowed to make DLC add depth to aspects, it shows it is a complete cash grab. From every bug and error they refuse to fix to the simple concepts they add to the game and charge $40, it shows the Sims 4 is draining money. When I first saw they added seasons as an expansion pack instead of a game update, oh my word, I lost my mind. They charge you $40 for seasons and weather, then call it a day. Don't even get me STARTED on the crappy details. Can we address how ugly the Sims look base game? They give you JACK to work with and then pride themselves in it. There must be more POC-friendly makeup and hairstyles, BASIC ASPECTS OF LIFE. Has EA ever heard of 4C hair? Ooh, it's the scary ghost of putting effort into hair, clothing, makeup, and skin details. It's not like they like the money to add detail to these things. I could write an entirely separate essay on how infuriated the hands and feet make me, but I won't. I love custom content creators because THEY are the gods and goddesses carrying this game. If I had the money to give them to make Sims 4 but better, I would. The gameplay is so dull after a while, making you laugh and then cry a little. You click ""Get to know,"" ""Flirt,"" ""Marry,"" and then you mass-produce a family. They go to work, eat for 50 hours, refuse to listen to you, and then die because they didn't. There is nothing to explore inside the world except for the park. Because I don't think people want to use the gym. People want to see places they go to daily and explore those environments. Things like going to the grocery store, DRIVING THEIR CARS, gas stations, random small businesses, workplaces, and schools. Some of these can be refuted with, ""B-but... buy the DLC."" The DLC that gives you three jobs and the ability to own a small business? How about the DLC that makes all the jobs playable and the ability to own, visit, and sell your small business? What should DLC be? Exploring obscure and exciting topics that aren't real or add depth to issues. How about the new wedding DLC? For example, you have to meet your parents. What if there were objections to the wedding or a runaway bride? What if the  DLC worked and didn't take 40 hours or longer to use? DLC should be focusing on adding to already in-depth topics. I need clarification on why you must pay to use critical aspects of life. The only DLC I understand is the magical ones because that is not real. EA knows we will buy the garbage expansion packs, so they make them. If there were a lack of profit from the Sims 4, more effort could be put into it. I'm not sure that would happen, considering they could quickly drop the franchise and abort the ship. Dropping the franchise would anger many people and spark further outrage with the game.

Clanny,[CZ] Colonel Clanny,"Product refunded I do not get the point why a game has DLC which are under normal circumstances as much worth as the base game itself, considering that these DLC mostly only give access to more playground and areas for your characters to be in. Same applies for other DLC worth 10 euros (discount 7 euros) which only grant access to more furniture, I most actually question what's up with the money grabbing action, I know developing games is not the easiest job to keep the customers satisfied, but this is just a very bad price. If DLC's would be at last half the price of 10-13 euros, I'd understand it, but please, a new world for fourty euros? The entire game for 500 euros (including all DLC's) ? whilst discount? Come on already Same applies for the base game (Yes, the product costing normally as much as it's DLC's), I have not noticed any changes from the Sims 3, with out of the way, that the sims 3 are using one base model with only a few customization options, I'm horribly shocked that the same has been pretty much just shipped over to the Sims 4, with a few tweaks here and there. You like the sims? Get the sims 3, it's just the same, yet, a better classic, and therefore, if you want to get DLC's, you only shove half of the money (19.99‚Ç¨) under normal prices into them. Unfortunately, as much as I like the sims, but alone the prices and everything considered aline, I cannot recommend this at all, unless you actually have money to shove it to a grabbing-money industry.

I was prepared for a lackluster base-game, as is the norm for the sims. But hey, if I can get $5 worth of entertainment it's worth it, right? First of all, it STILL requires origin, which is a huge blow. The game still lacks autosave so far as I can tell (yeah my previous games were modded). Then I run into a glitch that trashes most of the items in my inventory when moving (ruining reward items. as a sims 4  noob I don't know how to get them back) and throws system errors at me. You dumb sap, you forgot there's no autosave, didn't you? Say bye to your meagre hours of gameplay! Edit 10h in: yeah it's got a variety of glitches and the game is kinda dull. Probably worth $5 but the origin requirement still blows absolute chunks. Edit 50h in: wait, 50h? Surely that means you like the game, right? It's called boredom + I've played Sims 3 to death. So far I've only had one family I've legit enjoyed playing. Been modding the game to add substance and FIX THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE IN THE GAME (hair colour options, skip intro, ultra-speed, sadly can't get an autosave mod to work). Still base game only.

DasStoney,DasStoney,"First off I love The Sims series been a fan since I was child like many others. I've put many hours into The Sims 4 on origin. I've had this game since launch. There's something about this game that's not fun and it's been like that since launch. Even with all the DLC I still feel like there's something missing fundamentally. Sims in this game feel so hollow, no personality and no sense of progression. Gameplay is also imo really lacking most of the time playing is spent at your lot because of all the loading screens you have to go through. So many missing features as well compared to older titles like come on it doesn't even have burglars which have always been in the game there‚Äôs no grit and realism. One thing this game does right is the Build/Buy and CAS mode and small things like multitasking, It's fantastic and the graphics are great compared to its predecessors. The Sims 4 really reminds me of a Bethesda title game where it's up to the modders to make it better. The support from the community is insane with all the CC available. When you compare it to The Sims 3 sims felt alive and the world around them did also. Could it be the lack of an open world? the lack of a deep trait/personality system? I really encourage Sims 4 only players to give Sims 3 BASE a chance just so you can see the difference in terms of gameplay. I hope ‚ÄúMaxis‚Äù can really improve on the next Sims entry.

Thanks EA, for ruining my opinion of you even more than the impression i got from the reputation developed by your actions in the past. I guess THIS is what i get for giving you the benefit of the doubt based on MY experience playing your The Sims series so far. I bought this game nearly a year ago, and expected it to work. And when i finally got around to cracking open the game to actually PLAY it, the damn thing refused to run. Refused to work, at all. I tried everything i can, and refuse to bother playing around with trying to get it to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• work so i can actually play the damn game. I'm at my wits' end with this stupid thing, it doesn't deserve this much of my effort to even get it to RUN. I don't understand what the hell's going on, but i got it before EA made it free. I bought the deluxe pack, and figured it would be fun to play The Sims 4 because i have The Sims 1 kicking around with some of the expansions. I just wanted to play The Sims man. But you pricks at EA thought Nah, let's make it harder on a customer to play a game they BOUGHT. I tried it on the PS4 i got and wanted to play it on my PC where i do most my gaming, but noooo. I would demand a refund, but Steam won't allow that. And so i will NEVER buy an EA product again. EVER. This has left a bad taste in my mouth and i refuse to be tricked again, goodbye.

drLeend,Mn‚ÇÇO‚Çá,"Made character named The Devil. Was doing gardening for profit and crime as hobby (it was her work, but with how much it was paying compared to doing garden, it was more of a hobby). Garden became too big for one person to work in it. Found some black guy that was living next door, moved in with him, sent him to my plantations (have tried hiring professional gardener, but she was coming to only water plants once in couple of days, even if schedule was showing it more often). I do not own Sims 4 on Steam (did try it on free weekend), but I have it in Origin, compared to Origin's version, it actually has English language (while my Origin gives me choice between Czech, Polish and Russian and I have no wish to play it in any of those languages). If you own both Steam and Origin version, when you open game with Steam, it still opens up your Origin and makes 2 different Sims in it (one has tag Steam to it and other one doesn't). DLC to Sims 4 cost a fortune, but without it you're not gonna play it for long. From nice things that you get with base game that I do not remember having in Sims 2 is multitasking for some of the things (can do toilet with phone together or talk to someone while gardening) and mobile phone (so you don't have to buy stationary phone, you don't have to run to it every time you need something from it). You can redeem Potions of Youth from completing milestones in different aspirations, so your sim doesn't age.

Today, when I installed the game via steam, I had hoped to finally be able to play this game without the origin launcher and its incredible annoying problems. But alas, no. Steam launched the origin client, which demanded that I log in, and when I did, it started updating Sims 4, but then reported the launcher was down for maintenance, and then put me in a forever loop where it demanded that I try to go online, which immediately kicked me offline again and again. I had to kill the launcher via the task manager. Eventually, some time later, I tried again, and origin again required me to type in all my credentials, then tried to update sims 4, but ran into some other problem and refused to update sims 4. I then killed origin launcher again. I waited a bit longer, and tried again. THIS time, when origin asked for admin access to update stuff, I said no. Origin then prompted again and again for admin access. I denied it a good 30 to 50 times before it finally gave up. I stopped the sims 4 failed update, and I finally got into sims 4. Origin kept prompting me again and again for admin access, and I'm now looking for a way to prevent the buggy origin launcher from ever being on my computer again. Go to hell origin launcher.

Now I have clocked 200+ hours in a month just on The Sims 3. I don't deny that the build tool in The Sims 4 is amazing. But the rest of the game was meh. The Sims 4 feels like a real dollhouse instead of life simulator. Even every sim is also looks like a doll. It is a total dumbed-down version of The Sims series. It is just because the greedy EA wanted to make The Sims more mainstream so they can milk the money even more. So they ditched many features from The Sims 3 to make The Sims 4 runnable in a low-spec computer. They knew that even a high-end computer struggled so bad when running the feature-complete The Sims 3. So their conclusion was: do not make a highly ambitious game like The Sims 3 anymore. Did you all know that even The Sims 4 was released in 32-bit only in 2014 and created a backlash in the community. The reasoning is no other than to allow older and lower spec PC to run the game, thus wider market segment, and MOAR MONEY. Did you all also know that The Sims 4 was exclusively on Origin too until this year? At first they want to escalate their Origin services. But now the market there is already saturated, and many people won't migrate or install Origin. So, they decided to put it on Steam shelves too, to increase the market again, and MOAR MONEY again!

76561199133267942,Smoczyca,"After ages of playing The Sims games I have to admit that I'm still playing it mostly out of nostalgia and that they are in my opinion the best life simulation game (for now). Looking at The Sims 2 you can clearly tell that there is no more passion put into the game. It's very profit-focused. ""Cost of all Sims 4 DLC in 2023 comes out to an astounding $995 (USD)"" confirms screenrant.com . The only positive thing that happened recently would be the free updates and how part of The Sims team tries to add some more inclusive features like for example vitiligo, hearing aids, pronouns/sexuality update. However what makes my game actually good are mods and the community. Even though I am Maxis Match person and don't stuff my game with mods (I have about 15 mods in total) I still find them essential to enjoy my game play. Not even mentioning that the bugs existing in the game and that the COMMUNITY (not EA) makes fixes for them.

toddismymom,LavandeSunn,"As a Sims 3 fan, I went into The Sims 4 very skeptical. Took a bit longer than I'd expected, but eventually I got into it and I've since grown to LOVE The Sims 4. It misses quite a lot of details, and in many ways it has less ""soul"" than previous entries, but The Sims 4 has grown into a game that, in my opinion, stands on its own. The art style is easy on the eyes, and the ""cartooniness"" adds a lot of character to the sims themselves. The soundtrack, though a bit boring at times, compliments the gameplay by providing simple background noise. It can be a bit buggy, but I've noticed nothing game breaking so far. The emotions provide extra depth to your sims and not only the interactions they have with other sims, but how they interact with objects as well. There's also a huge plethora of skills I did not anticipate, including but not limited to Charisma, Comedy, Flower Arranging, Mixology, Cooking, Gourmet Cooking, Programming, Photography, Video Gaming, Singing, and many more. Most of my complaints revolve around the lack of options for cosmetics without DLC, especially compared to the ""create a style"" feature in The Sims 3, which allowed you to select patterns and change the exact colors of every piece of clothing (as well as hair and makeup) using a color wheel, hex numbers, and RBG values. This allowed for a much deeper and rewarding create-a-sim. I always enjoyed taking specific sims and giving them a color theme, that most of the outfits were built around so they felt more unique. This is severely limited in The Sims 4. Lastly, there are the DLC packs. Plenty of them are good, some are REALLY good, and some are... disappointing. Overall I dont suggest buying this unless its on sale, but that especially applies to the DLC. Though I can particularly recommend Get to Work, Seasons, Get Famous, Parenthood, and Vampires.

EA are a money hungry company, they charge extra for these ""packs"" which are really just forcing you to pay them over and over again for just a tiny bit of furniture or a pet or something. Its really awful. The base game itself really isn't even considered a game, you cant have the characters do anything because its all locked behind the pay walls (packs). You can barely even make anything interesting. It seems fun in concept, that's why I tried really hard to like it. But quite frankly the way EA monetises these games is just disgusting. DLC is fine as long as you don't pay wall literally everything. They don't understand this and don't care.

iamzachhunter,iamzachhunter,"The Sims is such a great concept. As a child I would sit in my dad's lap and watch him play the Sims 1 and 2, and I've poured hundreds of hours into 3 and 4 over the years. I can only imagine how great of a game the Sims 4 would be if EA didn't lock content like: high-school, college, interactive careers, pets, seasons, weather etc. behind a $40 paywall each. It is disgusting. Most of the aforementioned content should be included in the base game. I don't hate the idea of paid-for DLC, but greedy developers like EA will make half of a game and release the other half gradually over the years in the form of outrageously priced expansions. $5.00 is far more reasonable for the various expansions for this game, but EA understands there are enough prats out there to burn nearly $1000.00 on this exorbitant trash.",7,0,-1,"September 2, 2022"

If you want the full game experience, it's in total more than 600 euros, I think. I can't support companies like that no way.

IF however, and only IF you are a headless cashcow  with no standards whatsoever, who just wants to raped repeatedly over and over against until your bank refuses to borrow you any more money, this is the game for you! They really exponentially raised the bar here in their social experiment how desperately people would allow to rip themselves off with DLC that offer very little to almost no content for ludicrous prices. The base game itself offers very little, and the developers have shown absolutely no respect towards the community's feedback. The whole game is a buggy mess, they don't fix their issues and instead focus on stealing more cash from you like the desperate blind helpless cash cow that you truly are. Hey, I get it... It's an EA product and they don't give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about us, I mean... What else should we expect That's fine, that's fine, but don't ever expect a positive review from me, this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is getting BEYOND ridiculous!! To have a decent experience with this game that feels like more then an empty shell you 'll have to buy tons of overpriced DLC that will run up to a 1000 euros, you can buy yourself a top tier gaming computer instead or a bloody car! PS: Each time I play this game I run into new issues that are completely avoidable and are purely based on EA 's greed and reluctance to provide an unbroken game to their devoted community who stood by them all these years. There are simply to many issues to mention to list here... But one of the things that piss me off most is that the game forces you to have an internet connection, even though the game claims that it works in offline mode, the truth is that it simply doesn't because the EA app (which shouldn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• exist!) doesn't work properly. Also the game is full of bugs, like for example when you move in an household from the gallery, 99 percent chance is they will be bald, and everything will be so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• bugged you just wan to shut this trash down and call it a day, so you are doomed to live in an empty world full of empty houses  or live on ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• bug world where most people are bald and look bugged all over the place (even when you specifically tell the game not to load content for the DLC's you don't own, and it destroys immersion so deep that it 's game breaking in my opinion). All of these things could be fixed by a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• amateur, this games runs like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• by choice, not because it 's hard to fix. For a game this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• expensive, the least I would expect from them is make absolutely certain that I can at least play it.

kelric6,kelric6,"Get the Sims 3...its not worth it. The Sims 4 is certainly enjoyable, but its a money pit that just doesn't do things as well as the previous Sims game.  You get less content for your money, you can tell alot is missing from the game which they sequestered off unless you decide to pay $10-20$+ for it all.  Like, there are building feature tabs with no items in them...clearly those items were made, but they purposefully left them out because they wanted more money.  I'm fine with that all to an extent, but to purposefully provide less content in your vanilla version so you can milk it is vastly different than releasing a finished product and THEN adding content to it to spice things up.  So whereas the base game is really cheap, a good portion of the DLC/contentpacks should have been in the base game, but were purposefully left out. But going to pros and cons- Pros: -Finding items on the world map is more exciting -Alot of restrictions that were more politically correct and limited character growth were removed -More customization/options to do various tasks than the previous Sims -Character interactions and graphics were updated and look really nice Cons: -Unlike previous Sims, they added content after Vanilla was released as icing; this game seems to have been made and content was removed where you will need to buy that removed content (what my mini-rant above was about) -Certain features are not implemented well, like finding items in the world.  Having certain items always appear at certain places consistently every few days cheapens the action -Its way too easy...if you start out with the normal 20k, start the game with $30 in your pocket and plan to slowly add to your interiors as you slowly get promoted, you don't do that anymore.  You start off with the 20k on a house, spend it till you get $30 and then you walk outside and scavenge to get an easy 1k every few days.  Before you know it, you never need to actually work to just have unlimited funds.  This makes alot of game choices and options seem very trivial -The new simplified SIMs emotion bar is incredibly easy, and it slowly loses its appeal.  You CAN change this in the options menu to the old SIMs emotion bar, but it leaves the same impression as if you found a way to cheat in the game.  Its hard to go back because the cheats make everything easier, but now that everything is easier, there doesn't seem to be much motive to do anything.  This should not be the default emotion bar, the more complicated SIMs emotion bars should be default. -Interactions are more boring...unless you buy the content flavor packs, its kind of like Crusader Kings...after 10 hours you kind of lose your motivation.  There aren't enough random events or things to do. Overall: It might be worth it to buy it ONLY on sale, but you'll need to get all of the content and flavor packs.  The DLCs are also just too small in of themselves...its like they took the Sims3 (which already had issues with spending money on lots of dlcs and content packs), somehow made it even more about money by giving you less for the same.   Effectively, you are getting a graphics upgrade for a few new minor features that aren't implemented well.  Stick to the Sims3, or better yet, the Sims2 and you'll never even care about whats going on with this new one.  Also, they plan to release the Sims5 soon so...why spend $150 dollars on this when you can wait to see about the new one (which I assume is a clone of Sims 3 & 4, just with a slightly different flavor of icing on it).",6,0,-1,"September 21, 2020"

TheTouho10,Touho,"Wasted potential - wasted cash The Sims 4 is the worst game in the core Sims-franchise to date. Being a major step-down from its predecessors and having base content stripped in favor of DLC's. The Sims DLC policy has always been horrid, but the Sims 4 brings it at a whole new low with many of the DLC's, which some might consider essential, costing the same as the base game itself. Even when buying these various expansions on sale, you're still looking at hundreds of Euros wasted. If you are looking into the Sims-franchise, look into the earlier installments of the series. The Sims, the Sims 2 and the Sims 3 are all excellent, less costly and by far more enjoyable, and the only real difference between the Sims 3 and Sims 4 is the jump in graphics and the abolishing of the open world aspect which many liked in the Sims 3. The Sims 4 is the embodiment of modern EA's atrocious policies. Regardless, as the base game of the Sims 4 is often on sale for a fiver, getting it isn't a huge dent in most people's personal economies. So get it, try it out and make your own mind, but for the love of God don't give EA 500 Euros for the DLC's, or we will see the Sims 5 with DLC that cost twice the base game.",14,0,-1,"March 16, 2022"

Requires you to install EA origin and so much of the game is locked behind the seemingly hundreds of overpriced dlcs.

If you have the cash to burn and are interested in the game, then absolutely dive in. Just be aware of what you are getting into.

76561198089424469,Regular Meat Sandwich,"I would enjoy this game substantially more if EA didn't manage to perfect the art of price-gouging you for half-baked ""expansions"" and ""stuff packs"" that don't even come close to justifying the cost, let alone add much to the game itself. I was an OG Sims 1 player from the start and have gone through each successive generation over the last 20 years. The Sims 1 and 2 brought a LOT of new stuff to the table with their expansion packs that justified the cost enough to be well worth it. Instead of a paltry amount of items and some ""new"" features, they were robust, contained a TON of new items, a lot of new activities, and overall just felt like fully formed product. The Sims 4 in particular has managed to water down its DLC to a point where you're basically paying $20 for a handful of things you care about, or to find out you literally have zero interest in what the pack ultimately contains. Simply put? EA has monetized every damn sock, shoe, blade of grass, and function in this game to a point where it's well past blatant greed. It is NOT worth the total cost of all these packs, and it seems every new addition is just more garbage dumped on a few interesting items/features to fluff it up artificially and make it look like it's actually bringing something new to the table. It's not. Half these expansion packs are DLC that either used to be a part of the base game in previous iterations, or would have previously been a part of a much larger DLC that actually justified the cost. It's unbelievably disappointing to come back to this game after a near-decade hiatus only to find it has deteriorated so heavily under the EA Overlords. To make matters worse, the UI itself is A T R O C I O U S. This thing is literally missing features that were previously a part of the predecessors' UI that were arguably integral to the functionality of the game. The Sims 4 is clunky, annoying to work with, and missing some basic-ass features like holding ctrl down to delete a floor tile, or being able to just place a floor tile. WHY IS THIS NOT A FEATURE? You literally have to build a closed room around it just to get it to fill with a piece of tile, and what is beyond infuriating about this is if you say, move a stairway trying to find the right spot for it between two levels, have fun having to mess with your floor BS all over again. Then there's issues like holding ctrl down to paint an entire room with the same wall texture. Does it work like that anymore? No, of course not, why would we not break something that was working great before?! Nope now it seems to be locked to the chunk of wall you put in, so if you wind up editing a room's shape or piecing it together as  you go, you now have to manually paint the walls and if you hold ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• down, it'll fill a CHUNK of SOME wall tiles that may or may not even be in that room. I just cannot for the life of me understand how a game that has been around for 20 years and had a pretty damn good UI and functionality in the Sims 2 (which in many ways, I'd say they nearly perfected, as it was simple, intuitive, and straight forward but allowed a huge amount of freedom), all for the Sims 4 to just.... act like it's never seen a Sims game before??? Great. The ONE FEATURE the base game DID bring to the table that I absolutely love is the ability to save/move/rotate/edit the walls of/ an entire room. Being able to copy and save these to your library is a true game-changer, and being able to poke around at these things certainly has a huge benefit as you build. Unfortunately this seems to be one of the only things I can compliment this game on after a couple hundred hours of gameplay. Thank god for mods, man. Granted, mods have always been the heart and soul of this game, but it would be nice for the game to also feel like EA is doing everything they can to drain my wallet just so I can have things that quite frankly don't even have enough to BE reasonable DLC. Unless you're a die-hard enthusiast with a crapload of cash to burn, beware: this game costs a stupid amount of money to get the content for and it is NOT worth the total cost.",9,0,-1,"May 4, 2022"

pickledmocha,cinnamoroll,"Ugh. This is so hard to review for me. I've been a Sims lover for a long, long time. I started playing 2, then 3, then 4. I have probably 2k hours in the Sims 4 on Origin. Most people would probably say 2 is the best, but I think it's 3. There is just so much story and so much to do in 3, not to mention the open world was amazing. Now in 4, we have....not much. Every pack we have gotten that was in a previous Sims game, sucked. Pets in 3 included horses and tons of small animals. 4 we only got cats and dogs. The improvements they made on CAS and house building are phenomenal, I'll give them that. But, how am I supposed to enjoy those things when I feel like I have nothing to use? CAS is ok, I don't use it too much so I'm fine with the stuff that's in there. Build/buy mode is a different story. I feel like I'm stuck using the same 3 rugs because they're the only ones that have swatches I like. Did I mention that the Sims 4 doesn't have a colour wheel? It sucks when you figure that out after playing 3 for so long. I just feel like the Sims 4 developers don't care about us. There have been SO many reported bugs that just either a) never get fixed or b) get fixed way way later. They only care about making new packs, and their latest ""invention"", kits. Kits. Are. The. Worst. I'm SO SO sick of seeing every single month ""hey guys new kit!"" They came out with that wedding pack pretty recently and IT IS SO BAD!!!!!!!! How are they just getting away with releasing a broken, unfinished pack? I have no idea, but it's very apparent that they do not care about us. EA stinks.",9,0,-1,"April 27, 2022"

Altough I had a blast playing the hours I did and had plan for even more, I don't see interest in recomending it since most of it's content is paywalled behind numerous and way overexpensive DLCs. Yeah... they're around 50$ EACH! A DLC! AND THERE'S AROUND 20 OF THEM! WHAAAAT THEEEE FFF-!!! There's just so much inconsistency on tutorials online due to the fact some of these have DLCs, some have a few of them, some don't have same ones than previous channel... So every guide end up biased on their DLC and expect people to have all of them, which is infuriatingly confusing.

evwake,Eric Wake,"Every bit as bad as they say. Only took me an hour to come to the conclusion that Sims 4 is an EA standard joke. That's an all time record for me. Character creation was already making me cringe. By the time I got past the insultingly limited customization options and horrendous interface, I was gazing upon the neighborhood map. I almost vomited. Previous sims games prided themselves on their big detailed neighborhood maps with tons of lots you can place any building on. Everything constructed and placed from the ground up if you want to. You could even ad purely visual flairs to your neighborhood like additional streets, tree coverage, radio towers, hot air balloons, beachheads and lighthouses. Sims 4 ""neighborhood"" is one screen with twelve lots illustrated with basic shapes. Literally the only option is to choose a lot. So once my Sims are on their vacant lot I find that there are no pre built houses apparently? The interface is so gobsmackingly terrible I couldn't figure out if there are. So apparently houses are assembled from a selection of prebuilt furnished rooms now. You just cobble them together to make your house. I don't @#$%ing believe it! This is what The Sims architectural simulation has been reduced to? Smashing prefab rooms together? Oh sure, you can add outlines for walls and stuff but, by God, is this interface terrible and aggressively limited in functionality. For some reason my dining room didn't care to put an entry to my kitchen. When I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out where the front flipping @#$% they hid the doors and windows I finally quit. Knowing that the Sims 4 and all of its numerous insanely overpriced expansions are all stripped down from previous entries I honestly don't care enough to fuss with this absolute joke of a Sims game for any longer than an hour. That's all of the time I'm giving to the clowns at EA. I picked up Sims 3 alongside 4 through EA's subscription thing so I could try Sims 4 on a lark just to see for myself what a pathetic joke it is. As soon as I started up Sims 3 I was immediately inundated with more options and greater functionality than the Sims 2 offered. To load Sims 4 and be met with less than a tenth of what any of its predecessors offer in terms of content and functionality is just ludacris. Stay classy EA. The Sims themselves also look stupid af. The Sims used to have an endearing visual style to them. Now they look like something out of a creature show. People. The Sims, Sims 2, and Sims 3 all exist. Nobody has any business giving Sims 4 the time of day.",5,0,-1,"December 29, 2020"

It is full of weird bugs like Sims idling forever instead of doing the next thing in their action queue, with plates getting stuck on Sims' hands causing them to be unable to do anything. I am also sick of EA's greed, a single expansion costs as much as the game itself. It's outrageous. Oh, and save your ""Buy It On Sale""s because; No, it better be a joke.

My only problem is that to really enjoy the game you need to sail the seas or shell out a lot of money which wouldn't be an issue mind you if this game didn't have morbillion DLCs. The quantity of DLCs easily makes this very expensive as you could afford a 4K TV instead. It's unrealistic to spend so much on a videogame so I personally did the first one.

76561197965261073,Kid Christ,"Love this series, probably always will since the 1st one. Unfortunately, they feel as though we should pay for everything they've created before again and again and again.  Mortimer Goth and family have been in there since the 1st one and every time I try out a new Sims game, there they are.  So I'm guessing Pets is exactly the same stuff as 3 and 2, just updated graphics.  I like the additional skill leveling you can do in this one, so you can eat/drink coffee and watch TV at the same time or drink a glass of water and read at the same time, etc... They have definitely improved some of the mechanics on this go around but paying almost $600 for all the content you've probably already bought for 3 and 2 and maybe even the original just isn't worth it to me, even @ 30% off.  I'll just have to wait until they do one of those 75% off sales and get a couple more packs and hope that gets me by until the next one. One of the reasons I loved this series was because of the value but EA seized on that love we all have for it and charge you over and over and over again for the same stuff.

The series have provided me with countless hours of fun, but unfortunately, I have to say that this is the worst game that the franchise has to offer, not only is the gameplay very limiting without the Packs, but most of Packs are very buggy, overpriced and provide minimal content. Compare Sims 4 Packs with Sims 3 Packs for example. Sims 3's Packs offered much more content at a fairer price and you didn't even need them, the experience was complete by the base game alone. Also, in my opinion, the Sims 3's Packs are plain better not only in terms of content quantity, but quality too. The only good things that I can say about the Sims 4 is that in terms of building/character creation and graphics it's much superior than its predecessor, it even has multi-tasking, but that doesn't mean anything when the Packs are this minimalist, overpriced and buggy.

The only added feature to game play from the Sims 3 is that sims can have moods (inspired, sad, flirty, etc.) and that can influence interactions and sim status (the color of the gem over their head). The customized style options for clothing, furniture and floors from the Sims 3 have been downgraded to pre-made options and no ability to actually make a custom color outfit (if you want a jacket in red but the jacket does not have red in it's pre-made swatches you're not getting it in red).  Sims' traits have been ""simplified"" to fit the new mood aspect of the game. Things to do in the game world are limited (there is a gym, a museum, a bar, and a park in every ""world""). Interactions with other sims is weird, my characters apparently don't like to look at the person their talking to and my sim will just decide they don't want to do what I tell them to do. Overall, get the Sims 3, the expansion packs offer more content and exploring the neighborhood can actually be fun.",4,0,-1,"December 29, 2020"

I enjoy playing the game, but I can't in good conscience recommend this game or any of it's DLCs because of all the bugs that still exist, even in the base game. On the plus side, base game is free, so I guess I can recommend installing the base game. There's a lot of little bugs that make the game borderline unbearable to play.... Build mode works fine, though, after you tweek the camera files to eliminate the camera drift in the Sims 3 camera mode. It took me 3 hours testing the code to get it just right.....

It's basically just Sims 3 with a worse Job system, no open world (therefore less content) and hilariously expensive expansions. When going into a next generation of your franchise you should at least include the ""best"" of the earlier generations in the base game. Prime example is the Seasons DLC. Four season should be in the base game and not sold for a price of feakin $40. The ""full"" game costs you about $700 total.

Unless you get some INSANE sale, find some resellers, EA stops being stupid or you straight up find a torrent, do not buy this stuff at full price, these are exploitative whale rates and EA knows EXACTLY what they're doing to you, lol.

Barebones the game is very lackluster and in reality even the complete game with EP's, SP's etc.. is pretty much the same BS as you once had to purchase since the first Sims. I find it hilarious that so many enjoy being milked over and over again. I get any company has to make money, but the effort EA puts into bending its' customers over is astonishing. I mean, I guess you can argue they made the base game free, yada.. yada... yada.... but truth be sold it is a mere ploy to hook people into getting the addon content to extend their game a little further and looking at the content available its D efinately L otsa C ash worth of addons. What's next, monthly or yearly subscription to play Sims? I mean why not, Ubi$haFT is doing it with Rocksmith+. Welcome to the new age of gaming where you no longer own the game you purchase, you just have a ""license"" that allows you to ""use"" the software however they see fit and not play it how you see fit in which they can revoke entirely at their own discretion. It's sad that so many are honestly ok with this being normal, as normal as the prolonged Early Access games getting a free pass for sometimes even years (*cough* 7 Days to Lie) because, it is an EA game, its going to have bugs.. Early Access lost its' meaning a long time ago but thats another rant altogether. They call it a digital age, but reality is it is an easier way for companies to screw you... and yes, I pin it on the publisher. I miss the days when no game required ""x game launcher"" to play it.

Jesperhh01,Jesper,"The game is good, but it's a terrible sequel to the rest of the games. It's a downgrade in too many aspects to ignore from the third game in the series. It feels less dynamic and soul-less. Much of the life simulation aspect of the series is watered down here. It looks better, but it feels more cartoony and lifeless. I like that they've gotten more inclusive though. The building has never been better. The perfromance is also better in this game compared to the third one. Many fans point out that they like the downgrade from an open world becauset the Sims 3's perfromance was bad. The Sims 3 has bad performance because it's built to run on a single thread. If a modern Sims game, optimized for modern computers, was to release; performance would be a non-issue. The Sims 3 was ahead of its time with its open world. This game should have been an open world too, it would run fine, and it would be a vastly more dynamic and breathing game. Many of the expansions are the same as the expansions of the previous games. There are just way too many expansions. The expansions contain barely any content compared to the expansions of the Sims 3. It feels like a total rip off. There's some expansions I didn't even realize was expansions until I looked it up. The business model of this game is one of the worst ones in the entire gaming industry. The only reason to play this game over the Sims 3 is that it plays more smoothly performance-wise, or if you are in love with the new art-style. In every other aspect of the game, with the exception of ""Build mode"", the Sims 3 is vastly superior to this game. It honestly feels like this game's sequel.",3,0,-1,"August 2, 2021"

grandcoomer,Graggle Gaming,"This game is stupidly expensive. ""But isn't the game free?"" Yeah it's free in the same way that samplers of cheese at Sams are free. It's just enough to whet your appetite and get you primed and ready to buy whatever they're trying to sell you. Only instead of getting a full pack of the sampler cheese they're trying to sell you sampler size bits of the cheese at full cheese pack sizes. Sane people don't buy into this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because who willingly pays money for samplers? The same thing goes for this game. The game is free but it isn't a game, not really. It's a peek through a window into a shopping center. It's perfect looking pintrest photos of things you want but can't afford. Then when you get whatever you're pining for you realize you've been had. In any other game you could've gotten just as much content for 1/7th the price. The problem is that there aren't many other games like this. It's not ridiculous to say that The Sims series has a monopoly on sandbox life sims, and that's why they get away with selling you bite sized DLC packs or flavor packs for the same price as feature length games sometimes! Besides the ethical problems this game is littered with bugs and weird menu problems. I've had my entire created household be deleted twice in a row for no reason other than I got booted back to the menu for some update. Why can't I save character's? Why does it have to be the whole household? Why can't I save a household until I buy land? Why does the save household feature just not work at all sometimes? Don't get me wrong though this game is fun, really. It's just that getting to where you can have the maximum enjoyment you can out of it requires you to pour an obscene amount of money into EAs guts. If you really want to play it I'd recommend putting on your peg leg and eyepatch.",3,0,-1,November 7

In addition, you have to install the Origin launcher in order to play this game through Steam. And, bonus fact, the Origin Launcher randomly decides that it wants to take up 40-60GB of RAM. Not to run Sims. Just because. Why? Who knows? Maybe they just like crashing out my machine. Or, maybe they're mining bitcoin on my PC. Knowing EA, I wouldn't doubt it.

76561198808249265,Nater K,"Classic EA - you can't get 10 minutes into this game without finding several major problems even indie games manage to avoid with ease. First, you have to install Origin to play the game you just spent 10 hours downloading. After which, if you're as unlucky as me, you find a non-deletable, non-movable shortcut now permanently plastered on your computer's main screen. Terrific. After the hours of installation and subsequent tedious installation of all the other mandatory data-collecting garbage they don't tell you about in the ads, the game itself is a step down from previous installments. It feels a lot like 2 except wonkier to move around. Your characters feel less in your control and more like you're just there to make vague, occasional suggestions. The actual characters look a lot better visually, although it's janky trying to edit their appearance with a mouse and keyboard, and their aspirations feel a lot more limited than the in 3. And you know it wouldn't be a sims game if they didn't deconstruct it down to sell you the ""vanilla"" game and package the other 95% of the game as dlcs.

LillaVee,Saathiya,"I'm changing my review for a few reasons. 1. You don't have to use Origin spyware anymore.  They have a new local launcher. 2. The base game is free to play, which invalidates my previous complaint that what amounts to the only virtual dollhouse that exists shouldn't be so heavily gated. 3. It won't be the only virtual dollhouse for long, but it will always be the first.  There will come a time when we point back at the classics. 4. They are participating in Steam sales now. 5. EA has now seen their most wholesome market -- kids who want to play with a dollhouse.  Family-based content has increased and it's beautiful. Remaining Criticisms: 1. The sale prices for the 2023 Spring Sale are fair.  The full prices are ridiculous in a bad way.  Older content should be permanently marked down, and the newest content can be a status symbol by keeping the usual price. Suggestions: 1. Multiplayer features are long overdue for this game.  Being able to visit your friends' worlds would add THE dimension that's missing. 2. While making full-blown modding easier clashes with this game's monetization model, allowing floorplans, worlds, and reskins to be shared via the Workshop (or an EA-centric, proprietary tool even) would be a significant improvement.  Community made past Sims games great, and community can do that again for a broader audience. Overall, not too terrible work recently, EA.

NyxKhaos,Nyx Khaos,"I have played sims since the first sims came out on PC, and sadly things basically fell apart and went down hill after Sims 3. Examples the pets pack included all animals (horses+unicorns), Halloween pack included wear wolves, vampires, witches and fairies. Yet in sims 4 they ripped all the packs apart and still didnt include as much in each that sims 3 or packs in the other versions had. EA has turned Sims 4 into a money pit. Yes I bought it, cause I couldnt help myself, and yes I invested, but only when there were actual decent deals during xmas and etc or when a pack went for free, but never paying full price though many of the original fans know we are still getting stabbed in the back. If only others knew what the packs use to have. What they give now per packs is bread crumbs...But no worries. There are a few other companies making games that give what we should have been given from the get go, and I honestly am happy to see the competition get their projects out. I wanna see AE lose money and sims 4 die. PS base sims 4 isnt worth it without mods, though modding the files can be tedious. It sucks when modders have to make the game actually great because a greedy company refuses to give their fans what is deserved. Yes I still play sims 4 but its because I mod the living daylights out of it, to the point its not even the base game.",7,0,-1,October 8
hazelgcy,hazel,"The Sims 4 arrived with much fanfare in 2014, promising a new era for Sims fans, but over the years, it has proven to be both a gift and a frustration for players. On the one hand, its improved graphics, sleek Create A Sim (CAS) interface, and unparalleled building tools offered a polished experience. You can fine-tune every detail of a Sim‚Äôs appearance by simply pulling and dragging, something unheard of in earlier versions. The building mode is perhaps the game's greatest triumph, allowing even novice players to create dream homes with ease and precision. However, despite these advancements, The Sims 4 lacks the depth that previous games, like The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, brought to the table. Where The Sims 3 introduced the groundbreaking open world and immense customization options, The Sims 4 feels restrictive. The open world was removed, and much of the rich storytelling and autonomy that made The Sims 2 legendary seem to have been traded for a sleeker visual style. While the base game does a decent job of simulating everyday life, EA‚Äôs reliance on numerous expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs to complete the experience has frustrated many fans. There are lots of expansion packs and +20 kits, many of which feel overpriced and lack substantial content. Features that were once included in base games, such as toddlers and pools, were only introduced later via patches, raising questions about the game's initial completeness. In the end, The Sims 4 excels in its presentation and ease of use, but it struggles to match the depth and innovation of its predecessors. While it‚Äôs still a fun game, especially with the aid of custom content and mods, long-time Sims fans may feel like it‚Äôs more of a step sideways than a leap forward.",3,0,1,"July 15, 2023"

therealtrophus,Chicken of doom,"If you consider getting this game but never played sims 3: Get sims 3 instead. Seriously. Technically Sims 3 has one downside. If you play for hours on end you'll need to move your family to a different neighbourhood or your savegame gets corrupted and your game will crash continously untill you export your family and import it in a different savegame. Sims 4 is more buggy, has more pathing issues, has  way, waaaaaaaaay less options both in design as well as gameplay. Sims 4 is inferior to sims 3 in almost every way. Even though I highly recommend Sims 3 above Sims 4, these would be the reasons to get the sims 4 instead of the sims 3: * You can choose your characters walk animation * The tropical island expansion is playable * Cats and dogs in the pets expansion demand less attention and are thus less annoying * Transgender sims * Children are less of a bore * Vampires actually have interesting gameplay (though unlike in the sims 3, in the sims 4 vampires require a completely seperate expansion pack) * Plots have traits, you'll need to eco expansion pack but there are actual mechanics to make eco friendly living an interesting part of the gameplay, sims 3 has a very minor implementation of this (clothing lines instead of dryers), sims 4 has a somewhat better (though  not impressive) implementation * Slightly lighter / more colorful color template. Though sims 4 completely scrapped sims 3's ability to make a personal home decor style, so it barely matters * (considering you have the correct expanion packs) being able to go on holiday to the jungle (though in sims 3 you can go to france, egypt or china...... so that's 1 destinatrion versus  3......",7,0,-1,"September 13, 2020"
AhegaoPigeon,Milf Tea,"As someone who absolutely adored the Sims when I was younger, I genuinely thought I'd pick up the Sims and dive back into the world after years of going without. Boy was I wrong, and of course as usual; EA comes in to spoil the fun. Can you imagine turning something genuinely beloved into such a hardcore cash grab? I'm use to EA being greedy, however this really broke my heart to see. Why are all the DLC so expensive? Why is the base game pretty much nothing? I remember when the Sims legit came with something, now it feels like there's nothing to do and all the fun is behind a paywall I'll NEVER climb. Seriously, this game is old; I still remember the announcement for it's release. Like the fact that people have to sell an organ(s) just to experience the nostalgic feeling of playing God is wild. Honestly, I'd say pick it up on discount, but jokes on you; there will never be one if you're looking to pick up ALL THE DLC FOR THE GRAND TOTAL OF, yep you guessed it! $939 USD! That's pretty much the cost of lets see, new console, computer (on a budget) down payment on something; take your pick really. Not to mention you're forced to use Origin, and if you don't have it, guess what you're gonna get it anyway! I don't know why this is a thing either, like anything that's attached to Origin forces you to use something despite using Steam, what is the point of buying it on here then? TL;DR: Don't buy this if you actually want to have fun with a game and it's oodles of content. Forced use of another launcher while using steam and all DLC are overpriced for no reason. The base game doesn't have anything to offer without DLC content which is just as expensive. Don't even bother with sales as nothing is ever discounted enough to purchase it all in one go.

RielleLeigh,Rielle,"I would like to say that I really did enjoy my time playing this game and I am glad EA finally decided to make this game F2P, however my complaint with this is that they handled the switch the F2P very poorly. Those of us who paid and have been supporting this game since the beginning and have bought several DLCs for the game got absolutely nothing as thanks from the company for supporting their game over the years. On top of all of this all the DLCs are still unreasonably high prices for the amount of content you get and considering many of them will straight up break your game. I have no real hope for Sims 4 going forward after having DLCs I was super excited about being trash time and again with no effort to actually fix the bugs in these DLCs.

ReiCaixa,Rei Caixa,"I have over 1000 hours of The Sims 3 on Steam, plus time played on Origin. I have all of the DLCs from 3, which were expensive but not as much as this. That game with the 19 expansions was just perfect, huge open-world, huge house, extreme car collection, cars could drive around town. I tried TS4, but the DLC's are way too expensive, and the base game is TINY compared to TS3. It obviously runs much better, but not something I worry about with my PC. And even from watching content from other people, the FULL TS3 experience seems much better than the FULL TS4 experience.

Laserhowl,Laserhowl,"Product received for free Originally a $39.99 game that went Free-to-Play. Saw a life flash before my eyes. Overall it was a nice experience playing a franchise I've heard and seen so much about. The music was a surprising highlight. Though the game does start to get tedious repeating the same prompts over and over after a while. Does suffer from quite a few bugs with object placement, stuck sims due to glitchy action, and a queue filled with already accomplished tasks. This is all pretty annoying on top of the sometimes very unresponsive sims that you have to set the same action 3-4 times before it actually gets done. Also at the end of my playthrough I hit a never-ending loading screen (which lasted 30 min before I quit) that made me lose some important progress. These quality of life issues are surprising considering that they are coming from a close to $1,000 dollar game.

It feels like the open endedness of all the previous games has been shut down, forcing you to play only within the narrow margins the devs decided you should play in. I dunno.

76561198849235671,kvarnet,"I have played this game on other device plenty of hours and this is an abomination of The Sims legacy and should be known as the disappointment in the gamers community. The more packs and games EA makes the worse it gets; the graphics are silly and the mods are THE ONLY thing that saves this game for now; it's extremely boring wo mods and that shows that something isn't right. The low expectations of the players and the simple action of letting games like these go and proceed are the things that make such companies as EA successful, and yet, they[EA] have done nothing to better themselves or even try to actually make the game enjoyable. The latest biggest pack (the ranch) has been a huge disappointment and that was nothing new, the foals are copies of their parents because of the absence of different layers for the skin, coats and patterns which exists for dogs and cats pack and that makes the game more fun (isn't it better to wonder what kind of offspring your sims would have rather than knowing that to make the child unique you will have to manually go into CAS and make a coat?) Not to mention that this has been turned into a joke of endlessly buying new DLCs, which keep getting negative reviews and will continue to do so. Rather than milking the themes it'd be better for EA to make something new in this industry and continue to base the games off of Sims 3 (which you don't even need mods to enjoy!), but even better. It's sad to see a game like this be let down by the creators, it had so much potential instead of becoming a farm for money (not for long, considering how much you have to pay for the ranch which doesn't give anything and the horses are a disappointment, especially when the whole community have been begging for the horses for YEARS!!). I hate this game with passion and will continue to love and cherish The Sims 3. Strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND - it's simply not worth the money (or if you do want this game, wait untill it becomes free because of the bad reviews like some packs already are). Well, there's another way to have it wo paying, but I didn't say that.",15,0,-1,March 26
76561198031417870,occitanchild,"Product received for free Out of stubbornness that The Sims 4 had stripped a load of features from The Sims 3, I had determined never to buy this game, but when it came up as free weekend, I thought I'd give it a chance, since it didn't require me to give EA any money for retrograde games. I've given it a chance, but its character creation controls are so counter-intuitive (the drag on particular parts of the body instead of sliders, the fact that if you have a character with glasses you have to remove the glasses to edit the eyes, not to mention the problems with personality), and its camera controls are dire and a huge step backward that I have given up after 2 hours and will uninstall after posting this review, around 24 hours before the free play ends. For context, this has only happened to me with free weekends once before: with Imperator Rome. Even if I choose not to purchase a game in the long run, I usually enjoy it enough to continue for the entire run of free play time. That is not to say that this game doesn't have good features: the fact that you can now make your sims transgender, transvestite or infertile is a nice addition (I am infertile myself, and it's nice to have some normal representation that doesn't seem to suggest that you are less of a woman if you can't pop out sprogs, or that you are a demented baby-crazy baby snatcher). The walk customisation does add a nice layer of creativity, as do the increased range of voice controls, and the range of looks options (hairstyles, clothes, etc.) is certainly increased. If you can't be bothered to build your own house the hard way, there are some default rooms for you to choose from, but, personally house building the old way was one of the things I loved in earlier games. There are a nice range of options and controls for that aspect of building too. However, for my part, I am utterly unable to work with such terrible camera controls, and the fact that you now have no control over your sim's personality save a bizarre questionnaire at the beginning of character creation is terrible. In The Sims 3, you chose personality traits first, then select from a set of suggested ambitions, or override the system entirely to determine this yourself as the player, now in The Sims 4 you have that choice taken away from you and your favourite author sim from 3 that you recreated wants to be an artist and craves other sim attention, when she used to be shy. I went back and tried another character, same problem, I don't seem to have missed a control somewhere. I even tried the tutorial, same problem. For a player like me, who likes to create lots of different sims to try different goals, ambitions and personalities, this makes the game utterly unplayable, and the controls cement this. In fact, I'm not sure which is the bigger turn off. All that said, I am a 31-year-old gamer playing with a gaming computer and a mouse and keyboard. If you are a 19-year-old playing with a touch screen and no memory of how good previous sims games were, I can see how this game might be fine for you, as for me, I cannot recommend this at all.

LemaNeed,Lema,"Gameplay experience The controls are very easy to use, with decent hotkeys and navigation. The game isn‚Äôt difficult at all, so I would say it‚Äôs very well balanced. Sims 4 does keep me moderately interested in the game and isn‚Äôt very excited when you play for the long run. In-game choices does not feel that meaningful, where I feel whatever decision you do, basically doesn‚Äôt have consequences or either good or bad rewards. However you play, you still could acquire the same skills, or even apply for the same job regardless of what you do. I can‚Äôt say that doing progress or milestones in the game gives players any rewards. So, I feel unsatisfied regarding this. I.e., making your way through life in the game doesn‚Äôt bring that much joy. I don‚Äôt feel like aging up in-game gives me satisfaction. Presentation & Immersion The game itself doesn‚Äôt quite have a story, so you basically have to create one of your own. Even by doing so, it doesn‚Äôt feel that much interesting because it doesn‚Äôt really matter. For time to time, you often feel very immersive into the game. If you follow and play with a few sims at a time, you feel immersed into their life and actions. Sims 4 is design very well. The visual art and style of the game is very appealing, but not much have changed since the previous game Sims 3. The same goes for the sound and music, this is also very engaging, but still a lot like its previous title. The HUD is very user-friendly and easy to use. Design & Technical Aspects I wouldn‚Äôt say that the game is design more than average mechanical wise. Because sometimes the game feels just more less natural and unrealistic. Sims 4 does have a lot of content, but many of these looks weird in my opinion, and there is lack of content in different areas in the game. I.e., the curtains just to mention. There are even lots of different DLC‚Äôs with even more content, which is also very expensive. The AI in this game is poor in my opinion. You cannot rely on the ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù function in the game settings. Sometimes a lot of actions just feel unnatural and sometimes I just feel the AI‚Äôs just do whatever stupid things they want to do without the influence of household members. ‚ÄúWhy would the mother read a book and turn on the music while the baby is asleep?‚Äù These kinds of stuff happen all the time and is very annoying. Game settings does give certain ways of adjusting the game and graphics. Still, I feel there are some settings missing from the previous titles. I.e., the level of autonomy. Here you could choose between ‚Äúoff‚Äù or ‚Äúfull‚Äù. And I do remember there were different options in Sims 3. Since release I‚Äôve been experiencing technical issues and glitches. I.e., for a year ago, there was an insult bug which made people insult each other all the time. The bug existed for a long time and made interactions with other sims impossible. It obviously made me quit for a certain time. The most recent bugs I‚Äôve encountered is tings like ‚Äúget leftovers‚Äù. Sims gets a new plate out of the fridge again and again without eating them. Causing plates with food being placed around every space of the kitchen etc. If you get a newborn, be prepared to have issues interacting with them. Because I‚Äôve had A LOT. Many tasks in ‚Äúthe queue‚Äù got stuck and couldn‚Äôt be cancelled. Which made me must restart and quit the game several times. While the baby cries og floats in the air just by itself. You can‚Äôt do nothing because it would not make you interact. Every day in a sim‚Äôs world, this happens. You can‚Äôt go one day without experiencing small to moderate bugs. Final Considerations I‚Äôm not satisfied with the game. The bugs, content, and game overall just fell more less real and stiffer than its previous title. You can‚Äôt even own a car, you can‚Äôt even see the town you live in properly, career options are more less available than ever. The experience feels more limited than it should be. A game like this could bring out so much more. And for a game to be 7 years old, I find it hard to be that many bugs and issues which seems too basic to even exist. The replay value is low, because if feels very monotonous and repetitive with every household you play. It‚Äôs kind of straightforward going from A to B. Even though it issues, I still feel the game gives a good value for its price because of it being free to play. If you‚Äôre looking for a game to play by growing a household with an expecation to play in the long run, I would recommend you not play this game. Summary Gameplay Experience: 17 / 25 Presentation & Immersion: 20 / 25 Design & Technical Aspects: 15 / 25 Final Considerations: 12 / 25 Poor: 64 / 100 Performance or gameplay falls significantly below the passing mark. Requires substantial improvements and may have critical flaws or issues, Not Recommended.",3,0,-1,June 20

coccaa2,Coccaa,"sims 4 is a fun and chill game, however this is the worst DLC implementation I have ever seen ever. The game itself is $40 but goes on sale often for as cheap as $5, but if you want to get every DLC, it will cost you almost $1,000 USD. That is the most unreal and hyperbolic price point I have ever seen in video gaming and it really plays into the EA ""lock everything in the game behind a paywall"" stereotype, which is starting to become a reality... The big content packs that cost $40 aren't even worth it by themselves most of the time. Good game, get on sale, honestly unless EA magically releases some huge bundle on sale with every major content pack for this game, I say don't even bother with the DLC edit 11/1/22: Game is free now so you dont have to worry about the price but still 80% of the content for the game is locked behind paywalls, the base game is depressing compared to the EP packs",3,0,1,"January 11, 2022"

76561198056514578,Matthew,Love this game over 2000 hours on Origin while not perfect or as good as The Sims 3. I struggle to return to the older titles because CAS and Build Mode. It is so much better in this game. Also not to have a game lag to a crawl is good but they need to work out a way to open neighbourhoods so you don't hit a load screen when visiting neighbours or returning home from that neighbour etc. What they really need to work on though is the depth of the game play as everything is so easy and there are not really any consequence to the actions you do for example you could have a sim cheat on there husband/wife and to start with the sim involved is not happy but its pretty much a few sims days later and all is normal. Pros Performance is great CAS is great Build Mode my personal favourite part Graphics look good for this sort of game Some good DLC Cons Lack of depth (BIGGEST PROBLEM) Too Easy Expensive (Its like an investment if you buy all DLC) Too many load screens Trait systems suck,8,2,1,"June 23, 2020"
jaybounty,Neurion,"Product received for free I've played the sims since I was a kid (I'm now 30 as of this review). I've played every single one of them as they were released and I've enjoyed them all (Except for a couple of the spin offs), but I just cannot enjoy Sims 4 at all. A few of the features are a good addition sure, like moods, sexual orientation, customization etc. But overall, it feels like a massive downgrade over the previous Sims games. I mean, if you wanna play the Sims but have no money then sure this is a good game to just play for free. But if you have some money to drop on a Sims play through, then I'd strongly recommend going with Sims 3 + some of the expansions instead. Sims 4 took away so many features from the Sims 3 that made it such an excellent game. Until Sims 5 comes out, Sims 3 will be my go to Sims game.",6,0,-1,"March 1, 2023"

DirkDickbutt,Dirk Dickbutt,"The Sims 4 is that game your angry older sister played growing up. Set in the fictional country of SimNation, and no I didn't make that up, you play as a sort of god-like figure that creates humanoids known as Sims and lets them loose to pursue their dreams, ambitions, and make a name for themselves in a world that is hilariously easy to accomplish your goals in. Property is also insultingly affordable. There's apparently some sort of lore for the Sims universe, but I don't know it and it doesn't really come up outside of some flavor text every now and then so instead I'm just going to make one up. Set a thousand years after a great war between the Sims and the Villagers from the great Animal Crossing Empire, the Sims of SimNation live in terror of the great mustache man in the sky (me) who makes them do weird things on command and also maybe teaches them how to use firearms to KILL. You know how the Sims works, but lets pretend that you don't or I hit you with a brick hard enough so you don't remember. You start by either taking control of a Sim, or a family of Sims, or lets be more honest as to what you're going to do, make a new Sim from scratch that is either some kind of OC or just fantasized versions of you and your friends. Don't feel ashamed, we've all done it. From here you move your Sim or Sims to a house or plot of land that is offensively cheap, and then either get them settled in or build them an abode to dwell in like some sort of digital goblin. From here you can either set them loose and let them do what they want, or control them and decide their fate. There really isn't a wrong way to play the Sims, unless you're one of those Whickedwhims guys. Then there is a wrong way to play the Sims. Even now, the evil seed of what you've done germinates within you. Don't be fooled by my Steam time, I have hours in this game going into the triple digits over the years. Am I an expert on the Sims? No. Do I need to be? No. For me, the Sims isn't really a game you super get into, but instead just something you putz around on every now and then just to see what happens, or just something to stream to your friends on a really slow Saturday.  But keep in mind, I am not the target audience for this game.  My version of the Sims has xenocide and death tolls reaching levels formally known as ‚ÄúUntold‚Äù A billion lives were not enough for Dirk. The Sims is a dollhouse simulator, you're there to either experiment, just have fun, or live out a fantasy. Sims 4 helps with this by adding milestones and achievements for your Sims, the more you focus on your Sims goals, the more points you get to spend on neat little buffs and doodads. Anything from becoming a great artist, to advancing your career, to kissing a girl (this one is hard), to stealing anything that isn't nailed down to the ground. Its neat to see Sims actually have a form of quests now. Unless they appeared in previous games and I just don't remember, like I said, literally years. The Sims 4 however has a rather neat mood system where you can tell exactly how your Sim is feeling at a glance, stuff like Happy, sad, flirty, hungry, angry, or just chilling, you are also presented with reasons as to WHY your Sims are either in a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• or good mood. I've seen complaints about it from other people, but I like it, it gives context to your Sims when you're playing it as just a game and not a sex dungeon simulator. Sims 4 also moves away from the open world that was featured in Sims 3, and instead goes back to the instanced zones like Sims 1 and 2. Its a step back, sure, but at the same time it means my computer doesn't light up faster than a Vietnamese jungle in 1968, so I'm all for it. I played them beside one another once and yeah,  Sims 4 actually does run a lot better on my PC, so it might have been the right decision, even if it does make the world feel smaller. Just playing the free to play version, you have a few things to do. You can take your sim(s) to a bar, go clubbing, get jacked at the gym, enjoy a park, see an art museum, or just kind of hang out in public areas. Between the two towns and the free-to-build town, you can actually stay busy for a bit without spending money. As a base game, the Sims 4 is just ‚ÄúThe Sims‚Äù You are simming, you don't get any of the crazy stuff like story packs or whatever that Star Wars DLC is about. Star Wars, probably. So, you like the Sims? Are a huge Sims fan now, want to maybe get a bit deeper into the series? Well, then you can look forward to purchasing the content packs for the Sims at a cheap price! Ha Hahahha Ha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. At full price, without discount, the Sims 4 will cost you about $1,500 Canadian dollars. That's about $1120 American Freedom Dollars. That's not just steep, that's ridiculous. To put in into perspective, Sims 3 was already pushing it at $500. So what's the strategy here? Well, you wait for sales, and unless you really want to, you don't buy everything. What you want to do is go through the DLC and pick out what you really want. Want Vacations? Get the Vacation expansion, want to experience University with your Sims? There's an expansion for that. Etc. From what I can tell you can mostly ignore the ‚ÄúStuff‚Äù packs. I guess they add some neat stuff for your Sims to play around with, but in the long run I doubt they're all that worth it. What else can you do if you want the Sims flavors but don't want to pay that price? Well, the Sims and Sims 2 are basically still around, you can't buy them from the EA store, but you can still find them if you look hard enough. Do you know how many boxed copies of The Sims 2 they made? Do you know how many are still sealed? I have three of them. But, there are those people that live and breath the Sims, and buy literally every expansion and every stuff pack AS they were released. It doesn't hit those people as hard as it would someone just getting into the games, because for them its like 10 to 50 dollars every few months. An MMO sub costs more than that in the long run. But yeah, at the current state of things, getting into the Sims 4 is a tall order. They're also very peculiar people. Go into the gallery and just look at some of the more popular Sims that get uploaded to the EA servers. You'll start to see a pattern of the very specific kind of men and women these people are into. Very chiseled, they're very metropolitan looking Sims that actually remind me of those urbansexual characters you see in Second Life videos on Youtube. What else should I cover? Oh yeah. At this point, The Sims basically covers everyone. Everything from sexualities, ethnicities, one (1) religion, and even pronouns, something I personally don't get, but hey man, you do you. You can make the Sims as progressive, traditional, or just as neutral as you want, you just need to be a bit creative. Do I recommend The Sims 4? As a game, yeah. As a product? No. If you're looking for just ‚ÄúThe Sims‚Äù then the free to play version should be perfect for you. But if you want the full Sims experience? Then you'll have to pony up a bit. The Sims 4: Free to play gets 6 made up Sim language out of 10. The Sims' original concept was for a house building game.

What Sims 4 lacks in personality (which Sims 2 definitely had) and open-world creativity (Sims 3) it makes up for in other ways, especially if gameplay-enhancing mods are added to make it more realistic and the sims a bit more ""human"". For me though I particularly enjoy the building mechanics. Also I've had no corruption issues that I experienced in my Sims 2 game (broken memories in Sims 2 often caused this). I also like the fact you can share sims and lots with others via the Gallery.

Judge_Mocha,KnightmareX,"Although this is the steam version, I have clocked in well over 2,000 hours on the origin version. This game is a load of fun. I will go over the good and the bad parts of this game. Starting with the bad. - Load screens. Loads of them. You can't visit a neighbors house without a load screen popping up. - The visuals on this game may not be to everyones taste, as this game took a more ""cartoony"" approach compared to the others being a bit more ""realistic"" looking. As for the good. - The ability to play more than one household on the same save file. This is something the other Sims games did not do. You were stuck with the household you chose first and couldn't play any other created family. As a person who indulges in stories, this decision was an absolute must. The fact I could play as one family and progress on them to a certain point, then play as a different family and visit the first to admire my previous work is a real feel-good feeling to me. - The fact that you can visit any purchased DLC world without needing to create a separate save file. You can actually visit any world you want with whatever Sim you were playing as without any problem. - The CAS (create-a-sim) is easily the best in the franchise. You can mold and shape your sims effortlessly in this game by simply grabbing nearly any face part (eyes, nose, jaw, chin, ears, etc) and any body part (aside from hands) and mold them in any way you want. The only thing lacking is create-a-pattern, but that isn't a big deal in my opinion. - The graphics in this game are best in the series. Although this is my opinion, I hated the ""realistic"" approach in the previous Sims, where Sims 2 felt dead and empty aesthetic-wise. This game feels like it has more life and color compared to the previous games. The sims themselves look great as well. The ones in Sims 3 looked too similar (and a bit creepy), whereas they look colorful and far more appealing here. - There's never a shortage on things to do. Sims 4 had a rough start, but has come a long way since its initial release in 2016. Even the base game offers a fairly good experience, but with some of the DLC (my recommended would be Vampires and Island Living), there's always ways to enjoy the game. - This game is a lot easier on computers. There's always someone complaining about the lack of an open world, but Sims 3 is an example of they we don't have an open world. The game was horrible taxing and had bad performance issues (unless you used certain mods) to run everything that was going on in the game. Sims 4 fixed that by separating the worlds and allowing the player to access any place at any time. This decision has resulted in the Sims 4 being easier on computers than the previous installments.

76561198160369016,Toast,"I purchased this game at full price, $30 or so on steam. No money back or a nifty DLC that can replace the money lost. OH BUT YOU GET A $5 content pack with less content that what a modder can do in their spare time. You get a 6th of you paid for in return, none of the DLCs that have equal value to their full game(at the time) which by the way there is no reason to price a DLC at the same value as the game itself if it doesn't include the same amount of content as the base game. Imagine buying a full priced game, and then there is a DLC with a tenth of the amount of content with the same price tag that was included by default in previous titles. EA has went from a company I loved and held dear as a teen back in Sims 1 and 2 to now being an absolute garbage fire of a greedy company. obviously there would be more negative reviews but i'm sure those who bought the game very much gave up on it and left it to collect dust in their library. I would refund this if I could but obviously I can't,,, Smart play EA, but like the age old saying; ""Fool me once"" Next time EA throws out another sims or game with even worse quality of content and more heftier prices for what should have been base game to begin with; Watch to sales plummet.

The Sims 4 has been receiving this kind of broken content for years - the result is a game that has immersion and mechanic-disrupting problems piled on top of even more of the same; these bugs simply are never addressed by the developers. In many cases these expansions have led to the corruption of save files that have years of game-play, making them unrecoverable. The modding community picks up the slack on EA's own lack of initiative to make the product function well (often for free).

I was super, super excited for the horse pack. I loved horses on the sims 3, and I love playing my sims in a ranch/cottage setting. However, the horse pack release was super disappointing. I spent $40 for a game that I couldn't even play initially, as the pack had been riddled with bugs. But, EA developers were quick to fix said bugs, so I put up with it. Now though, I can't play the sims 4 as it won't launch on my laptop. I've tried everything, but the EA app just won't work. Whenever I try to launch the game itself, it redirects me to the EA home screen but then it disappears literally a second later. There are just too many bugs and glitches for this game to cost so much money. Plus, the horses like so cartoony. The sims 3 horses looked so much better and more realistic imo But, I guess that doesn't matter when I can't even launch the game now. If EA would fix all of these issues, I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. But, as of right now, there are just too many issues.",4,0,-1,"July 23, 2023"

ninthjake,Curtain Cobain,"Bought this on the sale a couple of weeks back. I have played a few sessions and I ragequit the game every time because there was constantly bugs with the activity queue where one would get stuck and my characters could never go to bed or use the restroom and would pass out instead of taking care of their needs, requiring me to exit to the main menu and load back in to fix it every time. This gets especially annoying if you have a kid and the parents get stuck in a loop and won't feed the child until someone comes and takes the kid away. The game is constantly updated with new DLC but they never actually update the game itself or do bugfixes. The game still does not recognize my GTX 1660 because it's ""too new"" and now the game won't even start because I moved it to a new hard-drive and I've uninstalled it and re-installed it completely several times, including installing it on the same old hard-drive again. I'll take it as a sign to uninstall this game and never buy anything from EA ever again. Good riddance. The game has been out for several years and it's still super buggy. It's clear that EA is just focusing entirely on selling more DLC instead of fixing the game. EDIT: I have since played the game some more (for some reason) since my initial review. The game has been updated a few times with some (supposed) bug fixes. Unfortunately it seems like most of my issues are still not fixed. I had to remove the game completely and reinstall it to get it to work again. It does recognize my graphics card now however. The issues with the activities are still there so I still have to re-log quite often which is super-annoying. I seem to be able to place beds next to walls now though, my sims don't warp through walls after sleeping any more so I guess that's an improvement. Still can't really recommend the game in it's current state but at least some of the bugs have been fixed. Is it an indication that they are working on fixing the base game instead of making more DLC? Probably not. I guess we'll have to wait and see.",5,0,-1,"July 27, 2020"

On top of that, the stuff packs are a COMPLETE waste of money regardless of which one you buy, I wouldn't even grab it if it was free stuff. I've played from Sims 1-4, and so far 3 has been the best. I suggest mods or expansion packs if you can sell your car, house, and left arm for them, or else you will lose interest really fast most likely. The only reason I stay playing is because of the modding community. Keep in mind, some of the stuff packs require expansion packs to use it, so if you get one, MAKE SURE you check before if it is possible to use it without extras.

76561198321043275,itshalstri,"The current state of this game is genuinely and absolutely pathetic. Fans of this game series have complained about consistent bugs, presumably since the game's release, but until the most recent update which made the game free, I luckily found myself spared from most of these despite playing for years. However, after the latest update, the game has become literally unplayable without cheats or constant saving so that a player can reset if a sim randomly dies. I have rarely faced any issues before recently, but now I consistently experience sims dying in 24 hours (a rather common bug, apparently...) Additionally, I have been playing a sim with a passion for gardening, and have come to see many, many bugs within the gardening systems. Not only have I had plants and crops revert back to seedlings seemingly randomly (I can only presume this is a bug and not a feature), grow when they are out of season (or vice versa; becoming dormant when they are in season), as well as the cowplant interaction to eat cake not appearing when it should (when the cake-shaped tongue is out) until I debugged the object. I can only assume that other aspects of the game have begun to malfunction similarly. And while this can't necessarily be considered a bug, sims develop fears in a very poorly designed way- my main sim, who lives with and is dating a ghost, as well as having the occult trait and ghosts in their likes, developed a fear of ghosts from seeing their girlfriend possess something (a very, very common occurrence in the household), as well as gaining a fear of cowplants despite petting, feeding and playing with their cowplant every 12 hours for several in-game seasons. And while I have experienced these issues in particular, others I know have not, and have experienced completely different bugs and glitches that I haven't, making it even more difficult to prepare for what issues may come my way. The issues others have faced are more related to relationships, as the most recent update has made them completely unmanageable for some players. As a game which has been extremely popular and adored for years, which previously had quite the sizeable cost, it is genuinely shocking and baffling to see the amount of issues with even the most basic aspects of the gameplay.",2,0,-1,"January 13, 2023"

76561198030853676,brett.caton,"I want to like this game but the base game seems very limited. It exists pretty much solely to get you to download the dlc. It doesn't feel like a full game. I saw the bit about it scanning your computer as a requirement for play, and I really can't think of any benign reason for that? If you are playing competitively, it makes sense that they would monitor for cheating, but someone playing solo - well, what they do is their business. And as soon as you accept legally that they can monitor you, what's to stop them accessing your microphone or camera, or just selling off whatever naughty pics you took of yourself, as happened to the celebs in the iphone scandal a few years ago? I do like the free mods, but again they actually seem more limited than earler versions. I noticed a lot of modders are now selling mods for this game. It is not a good sign that people are willing to pay for content, as that means the owner of the IP is not meeting the demand of the marketplace with the game. Looking as sims 4, it doesn't seem to be as successful as sims 3 - and sims 2 had a big cultural impact. Maybe it is just too dated a concept now? I feel meh to be honest. The DLC is on sale, but nothing of it really excites me, and the weird way EA says they can block you from playing your own game after you paid them for it makes me ponder the wisdom of purchases. What if they decide to block everyone without the correct gender pronouns? Or anyone under six foot? I mean, they can, that's the point, it's crazy, but that is legally what they can do, and they don't seem to be required to give you a refund. So do you actually buy the game or are you just ""leasing an experience"", as they say? Because I'd have to say it reminds me a heck of a lot of the John Deere Tractors fiasco.",3,0,-1,"March 18, 2023"

76561198150577520,Whion,"I've been playing Sims since 2001 and unfortunately I can't recommend Sims 4 for MANY reasons. 1. Greedy practices EA do what EA does. There is currently $765 worth of DLC... $765. Most of the stuff in those packs is stuff that would have been included in full packs in the past. Vampires are a $20 pack... $20 for a life-state and a small neighborhood. Supernatural in Sims 3 was $40 with so much more on offer. Sure, it didn't have the skills of Vampires but those skills were kinda one dimensional. $20 for camping? $20 for a jungle adventure? Seriously? Stuff packs maximum are worth $5. No more. At launch, there was HUGE (deserved) backlash for so many missing basic features. Like pools, hot tubs, terrain tool, and more. Some of this stuff was sold back to you as DLC. Also: My First Pet Stuff. That pack is the EPITOME of EA's greed. 2. Lack of any depth and meaningful gameplay Sims 4 just feels so hollow. It doesn't feel like a Sims game. It feels like my choices and my Sims' stories simply don't matter or make a difference. When I take my Sims places, I just have to complete a small checklist and boom: all done! No real weight or impact is made. In other games, my choices made an impact (moreso in 3 and 2 than in 1 but still) such as divorcing your spouse and getting arrested (in 3). Choices carried weight and Sims 4 doesn't have that weighted choice. It feels like you do a thing... and that's it. No impact or consequences. You just go on as if it didn't happen. Due to the emptiness of the game, it gets incredibly boring incredibly quickly and I can't play for more than an hour at a time. Complexity does not equal depth and meaningful gameplay. Blizzard Entertainment still hasn't learned that yet either. You can easily complete a pack's content within a few hours if you work at it hard enough. 3. Retraction of Features Sims 4 removed one of the best things the series introduced: open world. I know some people had issues with Sims 3 myself included but the open world is seriously awesome. Despite how bad the story progression (this can be turned off in 3) could get, your choices had impact due to how others around you would react. Sims 4? No open world. No progression. Nothing. It doesn't exist. What about Create-A-Style? NOPE! What you see is what you get. When the game launched, it had 88 missing features... EIGHTY EIGHT! Included in previous base games. EA/Maxis' reason for the removal of CAS and OW was due to engine limitations... total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. One mod with open-world Sims 4 maps has just been released and another is on its way. You can't pull that crap when fans can surpass those ""limits"" effortlessly. Sims 4 prioritized artstyle and system specs over actual gameplay. After six years (seven in 2021), EA/Maxis still haven't made the Sims 4 any more compelling or fun to play. 4. The big one: the Sims themselves are boring and infuriating The Sims in the Sims 4 have the exact same personality as the other. I know, I know; they have the emotion system and traits. That's just it; that's all they have! The emotion system, while cool in theory, is so easily manipulated and every sim is affected the same way so everyone is essentially the same person. Also the emotions mean... nothing. Working out with one emotion versus another does jack for gameplay purposes. Sims 2, 3, and 4 both have an issue of nearly identical actions, but in 2 and 3 at least some of those actions changed things up. Sims 4's actions all blend together. Nearly every computer action in Sims 4 (as an example) is the same: hacking money, playing games, chatting with friends all seem exactly the same. There's no variety. Sims in 1, 2, and 3 also did what you told them to do and did things on their own if they felt they needed to (such as pee if they needed to do so and were uncommanded). Sims in 4 will fight you. They seem to want to do their own thing apart from what you want. Want your Sim to get food? Nope! He's painting a cheeseburger. Want your Sim to shower? Nope. Traits themselves are hollow. Adults get three. THREE! Sims 3 Adults got five. These traits are just very minor changes to the Sims as well. In Sims 3, these traits would affect a great variety of things such as skill speed, your progression, and overall experience your Sims would have. In Sims 4, the traits you pick seem to have very little effect on anything you do. Maybe a minor change here and there but otherwise it's not noticeable at all. Overall, the Sims 4 lacks depth and basic features while still being milked to death by EA. If you absolutely MUST have this game, get it on a huge discount (and don't buy My First Pet Stuff if you value your wallet and your pride). I remember being intrigued about Sims 4 when it was coming out and how disappointed I was in it. In 2020, I still feel disappointed. I couldn't recommend it in 2014 and I still can't recommend it now. I know some Sims 4 fans will probably be ready to jump down my throat at this review because they adore it. You can enjoy Sims 4! I never said you couldn't! I just don't think Sims 4 lives up to the expectations this series has made for itself over the years. At first I thought I had outgrown the Sims with Sims 4, but I literally sat down for hours on end in Sims 3 just recently for a week! It's not the fans who grew up, it's the series that abandoned itself. I have more playtime on my Origin by the way.",2,0,-1,"December 20, 2020"

S4 has gotten better over the years, but it took a LONG time to get here. The community has been carrying this game, easily.

goodboyHU,Goodboy,"Be careful if you have The Sims 4 on Origin already then DON'T install the Steam version!!!! I bought Sims 4 on Origin already in 2016 and have over 600 hours playtime, now everyone get the basegame for free...i paid 20 eur for this on a sale and for those who paid for the basegame they had a chance to get a 5eur DLC for free, but it was only available for like 3 days and i missed it :( now i got nothing I like the Sims 4 basegame, i mean you can still have a lot of fun only with basegame, you don't need to buy all the DLC for 994 eur .There are many mods and CC you can download and modify your gameplay, thats what i enjoy the most. If you want you can add guns and make a serial killer or make a superhero with mods. You have the opportunities. XD From DLC i bought only 2 bigger packs: Get to Work and Get Together, from small packs: Vampires and Jungle Adventure. Be careful if you have The Sims 4 on Origin already then DON'T install the Steam version!!!! Thats why: i wanted to try the Steam version and i installed it here too ( i have Origin version already installed), now the Steam version ask me to login again to an Origin account, after i tried the Steam version i went back to my Origin savegame. Now for some reason the Steam version overwrite my Sims 4 folder and the /:C location and it only started my Steam version, it doesn't let me change it that i want play my old Origin savegame.I made quick a backup from my 600 hours savegame. There was no other solution: i needed completely uninstall Sims 4 on Steam and Origin version too, then reinstall Origin launcher, delete all the folders SIms 4 Steam version created and then install SIms 4 on Origin again to fix it. This took me hours to do, the install is really slow :/ Atleast i was able to secure my old savegame and run it again. I never play this on Steam from now...",4,0,-1,"December 6, 2022"

Echoshy,Skylar,I initially bought this on origin thinking and being told it was never coming to steam. Eventually however it came to steam but the issue i have is i had payed for this twice once on origin because they said they weren't going to release it on here. And once on steam so i can play it from my library on here since they wouldn't budge on giving me a cd key for my copy i had on origin so i could transfer it to steam. What kills me is that they have also made this free to play screwing over anyone who actually paid for the base game initially (And offered nothing for compensation). Not to mention the dlcs are overkill and overpriced if you buy all of them you will easily spend 1000+ on just dlc alone. What they have done differently since the previous game is make all the essential gameplay items locked behind dlc so you pay more instead of expanding on the base game. I highly suggest giving this game a pass your wallet will thank you.,3,0,-1,"January 16, 2023"
Saphfyre,Runa,"The Sims is my favourite game ever. I have over 3000 hours played in Origin. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is broken. EA keeps releasing broken DLC because they know people will buy their crap anyway. If you love the Sims, stop buying DLC until the game is fixed. The game is utterly unplayable without mods and there are so many constant updates with new crap that it's just an utter pain to constantly have to update your mods, only for a new thing to break when the EA team adds an item that breaks the whole game.

76561199150669360,Cookielqnd,"Honestly, Sims 3 had so much more content that made it immersive. Instead of only being able to walk around the block a bit, sims 3 let you explore the entire area and even had Easter Eggs, such as finding the unicorn- to which I wont spoil how. Anyways, the graphics are sub-par at best without custom content which takes ages to do and a lot of them glitch or dont work properly. Sims is getting greedier and greedier with all these expensive DLC that honestly should be part of the base game. I mean I have to pay 14$ to have laundry accessories? Dont waste your time unless you dont mind spending hours finding custom content that works ( WHICH IS HARD, A LOT OF MESHES ARENT ATTACHED AND SUCH) Overall, If you dont mind a simple family simulator then this is fine, however if you are looking for a sims 3 upgrade this would be considered the opposite in my opinion.

76561197995775517,The_Engineer,"Pros: - It is easy to build - There are plenty of options to build - even in several stories, basement included. - The job opportunities seems to be many - Whether it is a plus or a minus, I do not know - but the sim-logic is pretty much the same - it looks pretty - You can pay taxes over the computer - You can to a great extend customize your Sims when you create them Cons: - It will be launched through Origin. So, if you can find it cheaper on Origin, buy it there - there are no achievements, a couple of cards, but that it all you get from buying it on Steam. So, unless you really need it to be in your Steam library, there is little point in buying it for steam if you can find it cheaper for Origin - The house maid seems pretty incompetent - You cannot make either the housemaid or the gardener come several time a week or even decide which day they should come - The game crash ever so often (my system should be well capable of running it, and yet it has it by, among others, crashing every first time I launch it) and it crash randomly when I play - It will be really expensive if you want all of the DLCs - Sims have it by cancelling whatever commands you queued up for no reason at all - The plants do not seem to live that long without constant care - It seems there is no auto-save - which would be greatly appreciated since the game crash so often - If you lock you door, and then go somewhere else, when you come back, all of your ""guests"" (read hostages) are gone - I guess at some point, it will just be rinse and repeat, but I am not entirely sure on that one yet. Conclusion: It is pretty fun to make your sim(s) go on all sorts of mischief and terrorizing the neighborhood, but that it still crashes ever so often despite its release in 2017 - I wonder why EA has not fixed this issue yet - of if they ever will. With that said, if you can deal with the fact that the game often crashes, sure, it is a great game. Though, I would not buy it other than on sale. Same with the DLCs.",4,0,-1,"February 12, 2021"

Even some of the item DLCs like Laundry Day make the game more immersive and enjoyable for me, but 10 dollars to wash my sims clothes is silly, I bought it when it was discounted to 5 dollars.

Open World is gone, there's nowhere for your sim to go except hang out on their lot. Even if you get them to go to the lot next door, it triggers a loading screen. The pretty houses you see in the distance? They don't really exist, you can't visit them, and no one lives in them. I can't put my finger on it, but it feels like the soul's been taken out of the game I knew and loved.

SkyeDarkclawTheEpic,Skye Darkclaw,"The sims 4 has finally gone free to play and ultimately I must say this game is very very enjoyable. If you want the short answer, definitely give it a try. The base game is decent fun with mods and getting packs can enhance your experience (given you research before you buy them) I am a very big fan of the sims 4, its the first and only sims game i have played up to this point. But after playing all the DLC packs, and playing for over 1,000 hours (Holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, also steam time is wrong) I feel I need to give the sims 4 a proper review treatment. I want to preface this by saying I really do love this game but after playing it for so long I have a bit of a mixed love for it. This base game is empty, you need expansions to get the full picture, the whole game revolves around these packs. You will at some point be blocked off from enjoying the whole thing without mods or buying a pack. There is fun to be had but it doesn't get into much depth, you will get bored if you try to make this into a serious life sim without packs/mods. But the problem with the packs has become very pronounced over this past year (2023), having every single expansion is great it gives you so many options, however it makes the game so bloated every pack wants you to experience the whole thing right now (except for Seasons and Growing Together) so each pack is always begging for you to do something with them. Another problem with the packs is how it really starts to show they are reaching the limits of this game's engine. You can update games as much as you want but they have a limit of game changing updates before the cracks start to show, and that is definitely the case here. The game slows down constantly, NPCs are confused, the game will randomly soft-reset all the characters. Its a mess, this game is 10 years old and it shows. But especially now the sims 4 seems to be grasping for any money it can with these packs. The last pack at the time of writing this, For Rent, is extremely empty, I thought it would be fun but there is so little content there and what is there is clearly unfinished and very buggy. However this is sold with a 40$ price tag, same as packs like seasons and high school years, when in comparison this has the content of a 20$ pack, not even. Some of these packs need to be lowered in price, Get To Work for example, is so small in comparison to most packs and a lot of the pack is broken becuase its as old as this game. Still 40$. The Sims 4 itself is not a bad game, its a really decent life sim and I am glad its free now. But the pack system they have built into this game is ultimately going to kill it. I honestly cannot encourage you to invest into all the packs like I tried to I know the sims 5 (Project renee) is coming soon, however they have stated that will be more of a spin-off and that they are just planning to keep making sims 4 content for the foreseeable future. (Also there will be a item shop or battlepass in the Sims 5 which makes me afraid already) There's only so many 40$ packs you can churn out before A. you run out of ideas, B. people stop buying, or C. the game starts breaking under the amount of updates. I suppose this is less of a review and more of a rant on the current state of this game, but I feel its important to point out for this game. Point is thats what I have to say about it, EA please dont run this game into the ground anymore than you have, just let it go",2,0,1,"December 26, 2022"

AthenaParthenos,Athena Parthenos,"I love this game and it is really hard to explain why. I think it is a game you are either going to love or hate. To me this is my go-to game just to relax and have some fun. I don't have to move through a quest line or go kill mobs to advance, I just sit, relax and play. There are aspirations you can work on and career goals you can do. However, I totally live vicariously through my Sims. Where else can I be a vampire one moment and a witch the next or maybe even an alien or mermaid. Where else would I be able to change my wardrobe on a whim or constantly upgrade my house to being the biggest and most beautiful in the neighborhood. I do like to play a lot of the challenges that are available from Sim character challenges to building challenges. The create-a-Sim and the building features in this game are easy to use and you have more functionality than you did in previous Sim games. One of the challenges I was involved with was having an alien impregnate 10 sims without them discovering that he was an alien. Another was creating an underground bunker with just the cheapest and lowest end essentials (bed, stove, etc) and one way of making money (easel, guitar, etc) and you put two sims in there to survive. I now have a 3 level bunker, my sims are maxed out on their wealth, they have had 12 generations and none of them have left the bunker. The children kept wanting to leave for school though so that just added another level to the challenge to keep them from leaving as you leveled up their skills before aging them up. My point is, there are a lot of ideas available to make the game fun and challenging if you get bored. I have played all the previous Sims games and I have been playing Sims 4 since its release. I do enjoy playing Sims 4 and I even still play my previous versions of Sims 2 and Sims 3. I did prefer Sims 3 for awhile but as more DLC's came out for Sims 4, I started to enjoy Sims 4 more than Sims 3. I did have to re-purchase the Base game in order for it to appear in Steam, but I did get it on sale and I felt it was worth paying the money to re-purchase the base game. All my DLC's are still there, they just don't appear in Steam as having been purchased. But to me, that is OK. I knew that even launching Sims through Steam, I would still need Origin as it is similar to how some other 3rd party games launch, but it is nice that I can launch from Steam and be part of discussions and chat groups that are available in Steam. I know that having to have an Origin login upsets a lot of people, but having been familiar with this 3rd party game play, I was not surprised or upset by it as I have many games that launch from a 3rd party platform. I know a lot of people are upset about the cost of purchasing all the DLC's and, in hindsight, I guess I did spend a lot over the years in purchasing the DLC's but I do love them all and it would be hard for me to choose my favorite DLC to suggest to purchase. I know in the discussion area, people are always asking which DLC to buy, but it will really depend on what interests you, from having babies/toddlers to pets to being famous to just being a vampire. It will depend on what your interests are. I do have a couple of Mods in my game but they are not really game or design changing Mods. I use one Mod that allows me to have an increased number of members in clubs (as I have a huge community of Sims) and I have another mod that allows my Sims to be members of more clubs. However, the modding community for this game is huge. I have several game friends that have hundreds of mods in their game that changes everything from appearance of their Sims to being able to be a serial killer. I would recommend this game and even though this game has is pros and cons, there is no perfect game.",2,0,1,"December 1, 2020"

TommyBlackTB,Tommy BLack,Really fun game. love the character creations and the building customisation. I really love how you can do whatever you want and make them do whatever they want. 7/10- 100% recommend . Definitely at this price cut anyway.,2,0,1,"December 31, 2020"
76561198416291801,Charlie_is_not_an_alien,"It is what it is. Mediocre The game itself is pretty good. Don't get me wrong, I bet some people adore this version of The Sims. The problem is, it had so many great features brutally taken away (like the ability to freely change colors of furniture), that it's hard not to dislike it. It really sucks that you gotta buy so many DLCs to get absolutely anything. In a way, I think they overdid it. There are SO. MANY. WORLDS., and the loading screen is the most annoying thing - Sims 3 didn't have that. Sure, certain users faced huge lag with the open world, but it was way better for me to have a tiny lag every few hours, rather than looking at the loading screen for the frustrating 10 to 20 seconds anytime I want to move around. JUST LET ME PLAY MY GAME??? The sims do not listen to what I tell them to do, all of the actions I tell my sims to do get randomly cancelled, random dishes that do not get washed, bad pathfinding??? God. Sims 3 >>> Sims 4. Now I am stuck with a kitchen that has 5 different tones of gray and 3 tones of black.",2,0,-1,"August 7, 2023"
foxchild02,foxchild02,"Honestly, Sims 4 is no where near the best Sims game but its such a nice game to unwind with and just zone out. I could be sucked in for hours on end just decorating or creating crazy family lines. 10/10 definitely recommend",2,0,1,July 22

This relationship is going to end bad Valve. Pay attention to how they took a bunch of excellent products from Maxis and ruined them.

76561199138482736,LilBabyBear,"I started playing the sims 1 as a child. I adored the sims 1, 2, and 3. EA has destroyed a legendary game and turned it into a  soulless, bland, ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù, pay to play, live service joke that they use to milk to the community out of every penny they can get. They use sell out content creators to manipulate players into buying every buggy, overpriced kit, pack, and expansion that does nothing to actually give this game any true depth. What used to be included in a single expansion pack is now split up between kits, packs, AND expansion packs and will cost you way more in total. If you buy 10 of those cheap kits, you‚Äôve gained nothing but a handful of recolored items, while spending the amount of money that could have been saved to get an expansion pack (or a different, more worthwhile game entirely). There is no charm in this game. The kit, pack, and expansions model is exploitative. The content creators fake their exaggerated hype and excitement to sell you some new DLC every other day. I can hear the YouTubers now ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so obsessed with this new toaster! I‚Äôm gonna use it in every build! I‚Äôm literally crying‚Äù. Half the community just makes aesthetic builds at this point, because the actual game has no soul. The base game is a joke. There are horrible bugs. But they try to pretend like they‚Äôre doing us a favor by not making a new, better game? Just be honest. EA wants to put in the least effort and make the most money, and they don‚Äôt care how they do it. They‚Äôve completely abandoned long term fans of the game, and put their eyes on gen z and gen alpha players who have grown up with freemium, free to play, live service brain rot and will buy anything that any overexcited YouTuber or TikToker says they ‚ÄúHAVE to have‚Äù cause they‚Äôre ‚Äúliterally OBSESSED‚Äù.

Nills_Bourbaki,Nills Bourbaki,"After logging over 1000 hours on EA, let me tell you‚Ä¶ Are you looking for a distraction that will consume your life? Want to create a floor plan just to see how that one rug from IKEA will look? Curious about what happens when you take the ladder out of the pool? Or maybe you just want to spend more time managing your mods and CC (over 8000 items personally, mind you) than actually playing the game? If your answer is a yes, then I HIGHLY recommend this game! It‚Äôs a delightful time where you can spend 10 hours crafting the perfect family or 80 hours building a dream house, only to lose it all because you forgot to back up your saves. (oops on my part honestly) You‚Äôll find yourself grateful for the ability to control a Sim's life when your own feels a bit too chaotic. Whether you choose to give your Sim the life you never had or embark on a ""rags to riches"" journey that ends in just getting the kitchen built, or even transform your Sim into an in-game Joe Goldberg(not saying that I did that...)‚Äîit's all in your hands! The only limits to your fun is how much cash you‚Äôre willing to pour into expansion packs and how much patience you have for mods and CC. If you're open to expansion packs or a crazy mod folder, I say check it out if you somehow haven't since its release 10 years ago. However, if you‚Äôre sticking to the base game without any additional content or mods, I‚Äôd recommend steering clear.

It's sad the direction EA has taken this game it lacks character from the previous 3 installments and I feel like the only reason this game is free to play as of a couple months ago is so that EA can get you to purchase more ""micro"" transactions. The sims 2 is my favorite in the series and its sad that you really can't access those games anymore. I also hate how they remove features from the game series (like karma powers in the sims 3 It was so much fun to make a sim instantly rich or rain a firestorm down on your neighbors.) I give this game a solid 6 out of 10 it's one of those games I pick up every few months just to build so homes and see what the ol sims are up to. If they actually built a base game instead of milking the fans of the series for every penny they've got I feel like the game would be a lot more than a house building sim. (Since thats all I really use 4 anyways it doesn't bug me THAT much, but I've got plenty of friends who've given up on the series entirely because of how much of a flop this game was.) cant wait to see some competition in the life sim department that might put some fire under EA's bums to actually  make a game instead of releasing 5% of a game and having fans pay for small parts of it 30 dollars or more at a time, AND DON""T GET ME STARTED ON PACKS 5 BUCKS FOR LIKE 5 INGAME ITEMS YUUUUCK!",2,0,1,"July 21, 2023"

So you think, ah, maybe I'll change the version of proton, well.. That replaces your entire proton area and save file. So now that 5 hours is somewhere in the void, because there's no cloud sync apparently. So.. To EA Take some of your developers off of the DLC cash cow team, and place them on the core game team. Ditch your launcher for the steam version, and add cloud sync. This isn't limited to Sims 4. This is ALL EA games on steam.

My only gripe I've got with the game isn't necessarily the game itself, but the DLC. This game has been out for almost ten years now, and the first packs that came out are still the same price they were at launch. This is the same issue COD titles have with their pricing, 10+ year old games still selling for $40+ (And even upwards of $60). If the prices were adjusted to match the age of the game (Plus with the recent announcement of development of TS5) I'd probably be inclined to pay the actual price versus going to G-2-A or other discount key sites for expansions. Steam needs to put a middle-ground recommendation for reviews like this, I can't really recommend the game if you plan on buying expansions but if you're playing just the base game I 100% recommend it.",2,0,-1,"January 29, 2023"

TronStylias,TronStylias,"The base game lacks a lot of things. I sorta get why sims 4 doesn't have much. The developers are trying to save frames maybe. However the way i see is computers are getting faster and faster and more people are upgrading everyday or so time keeps changing. So sims4 should really look at improving their game and add more things not short DLC's there's hardly any updates besides fixing bugs. The fact you have to buy expansion packs or DLC's to have more things in the game is not worth. I have see many people making private mods or downloading cracked versions of DLC's.  It's not worth buying overpriced DLC's since the game is singleplayer. So many people will continue to pirate the DLC's or mod their version remake sims4. If this game featured online mode where you can play with others in first person or third person then maybe it's worth it I can see the DLC's being worth buying if it was online interactive with others in gameplay.  At this point the sims 4 will probably never have an online mode and i see mostly DLC's will be released.  It's fun to build a sim and house but playing the sim can get very boring. Honestly Roblox version of Sims4 is way better. For example games like RoCitiziens or Bloxburg allows you to build houses and talk to people you could go first person or third person. GTA V RP- role-play does a way better job than sims 4. Since they have proximity chat and features many jobs such as cops, criminals, or other normal civilian jobs. They also have the hunger bar if they don't eat they die and other social bars. In conclusion Sims 4 lacks the experience in the game we get excited about making our sims for hours and building houses. But when we play the game we instantly get BORED and that's just a fact they fail to give sims 4 an experience like maybe driving, skydiving, exploring foreign countries or have proximity chat with other sims. If they wanted to keep the game single-player at least add more interactive activies and not DLC's this game could feature a battlepass like all the other games lol.",2,0,-1,"December 1, 2022"

neurononymous,Neurononymous,"I adore the sims 4, the sims franchise has been lart of my life as a kid, and this game really pushed the boundaries when it came to build buy mode and the depth of gameplay. BUT the combined dlc costs ¬£700. That's literally just EA trying to hog your money. If you want packs, buy them through CD key sites not Steam or EA. I've already saved well over ¬£100 doing this. I will share some of the best and worst packs though (in my opinion) I love: -Get together -Discover University -Cats and Dogs -Cottage Living -Dream Home Decorater -Eco Lifestyle I hate: -Journey to Batuu -Luxury Party -My First Pet Stuff -Almost every kit (they're a ripoff) I am not a fan of the fact they've made the recent additions of inclusive CAS assets DLC rather than base game either. No one should have to pay for their culture. But I will say they're very well made if you're interested in them. Just buy them on sale, don't let them take more money than necessary for that. I've rattled on about the things I hate but that's more about EA as q company. This game is genuinely so worth the price for base game and has so much replayability.

The modding community for sims is great, and you should try and find mods and different cc to make your gaming experience better. Last thing i'll say is that I LOVE the character creation tool. It's insanly fun to just create sims, and never play with them lol.

Just  know unless you are willing to buy a few of the DLCs this game is not worth getting at all.

NxT_Luca,Luca,"I first played The Sims 4 years ago, when it was first ported over to PS4. I played it for a few weeks and then moved onto other things, having seen it all before ‚Äì or so I thought. Having spent countless hours on the original The Sims way back when, I was impressed with the evolution, but beyond that I just wanted to get back to the nearest shooter or dungeon crawler. Picking up a new PC in December last year, though, led me to wandering around the lonely aisles of the online storefront. I tend to lurk in Steam for hours, shortcut through the Epic Store when I‚Äôm feeling brave, check in with Microsoft to be sociable, etc. And so it was that I found myself downloading the Origin launcher, against the better judgement of whatever remains of my buyer‚Äôs conscience. And right there was The Sims 4, for the low price of ¬£8.99. The Sims 4 2020 review Now I‚Äôll be honest, my kids have been playing it on PS4 lately and so I had been recently exposed to it and was wondering how much had changed. The one thing I was very aware of was how many content packs, ‚Äústuff packs‚Äù, game packs and expansions had been released since the launch. To download all of it runs into the ¬£100s. With the addition of Tiny Living, offering small building spaces and minimilist props, it seemed a good time to get back into it. With a review code from EA and a handful of packs I bought myself, I decided to re-review The Sims 4 for 2020. Is it worth buying if you never have? Is it worth jumping back into if you‚Äôve long since walked away? The first thing I‚Äôll say is that stuff is important in The Sims 4. I wouldn‚Äôt ever usually recommend anyone spend money on microtransactions or DLC unless you really love the game in question, but if you have a bit of spare cash on the occasions when there‚Äôs an Origin sale or a holiday sale, it‚Äôs worth grabbing a few packs, especially with the base game so often reduced to less than ¬£10. The Sims 4 2020 review I set to work sculpting the GodisaGeek team, an as finely-tuned and well-rounded a group of individuals as any (honest) and dropped four of them into a pair of newly furnished apartments in the San Myshuno neighborhood available with the City Living pack. I had forgotten how much of a joy it is to just sit back and watch these little people go about their business. The Sims, I mean, not the Geek team. I‚Äôm not sure if real life Adam sleeps as much as his Sims 4 counterpart (seriously, the dude went to sleep on the floor of a karaoke bar during a date) [Editor‚Äôs note: all I want to do is sleep, the dating part is the unrealistic part], but leaving them to get on with it is still as much fun as it ever was. But the more stuff you have, the harder it is to control your Sims. They want to play guitar or paint a picture, mix drinks at their mini-bar, or spend hours star-gazing with the telescope. I‚Äôve always found it funny how most Sims have that casual don‚Äôt-give-a-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that leads them to just go to bed mid-conversation because they‚Äôre tired, or wander into another Sims house and make dinner. The last big expansion was Island Living, a pack that allows you to either visit the tropical paradise of Sulani, or build a home there and move in. This, along with the City Living and Discover University packs, has done more to change the overall pace and face of The Sims 4 than any of the others. In Island Living you can swim with dolphins, meet mermaids, open a beach bar and live out the kind of fantasies that matter to someone my age. In Discover University you get to have fresh adventures in higher education, while the City Living pack turns The Sims 4 into a more slapstick version of your favourite 30-something sitcoms. The Sims 4 2020 review Having now been around now for almost 6 years and still being supported with new expansions, The Sims 4 is showing no signs of going away and honestly, I‚Äôm here for it. It has the same problems, still, as The Sims has always had with AI and pathfinding, and now and then a Sim will steadfastly refuse to follow any kind of instruction or will stubbornly defy you in ways that make you believe in the possibility of computer sentience, but there‚Äôs so much content now that even if you only stretch to a pack or two here and there, there‚Äôs a ton of stuff to do. You can have kids and outfit their rooms; you can buy romantic props for the garden, build greenhouses, have pets and fall in love while walking them in the dog park. There are restaurants and ice cream parlours and a school of magic, if you‚Äôre that way inclined. The biggest shame is that EA charge so much for the packs. An odd free one here and there wouldn‚Äôt go amiss, especially considering The Sims 4 had a reported 20million unique users as of January of this year. That‚Äôs impressive for a six year old game that isn‚Äôt a MOBA or an MMO. Despite the news that The Sims 5 is likely to release in 2020, there‚Äôs still so much on offer in The Sims 4 that I can‚Äôt imagine needing to move on just yet. Ultimately, The Sims 4 just offers me something different. My usual games are much darker anf more violent affairs, and I‚Äôve always been turned off by the majority of colourful platforms and family titles. But The Sims 4 is something I can just put on and drift around in, hopping between households and locations as the mood takes me. It may not be anything new, but The Sims 4 in 2020 is definitely alive and kicking, and if you‚Äôve got the green to invest in at least one of the bigger DLC packs ‚Äì or even the game packs that provide actual mini campaigns and objectives ‚Äì there‚Äôs enough content to keep you building, buying and living vicariously for a few more years yet.",2,0,1,"April 21, 2021"

LillyElessa,Lillium,"I've tried to figure out how to write a review for Sims 4, and perhaps sometime I will post up a better review. But in very short: - You NEED to buy at least one expansion pack (frankly, the more the better), because the base game is sort of an empty shell for putting more into. Buying during sales only seems to be highly prevalent in the Sims community, because it gets expensive fast. - If you don't buy a lot of packs, there is a TON of CC that you can get for free across a ton of fan sites. Even if you have all of the packs, there's some truly amazing CC that will enhance your game a ton. - If you're familiar with older Sims titles, Sims 4 has the most in common with Sims 2, but will be VERY different. Sims 4 has a lot of its own fresh takes on the franchise, so while some old loved things are very different, the fresh take has breathed a lot of new life into the Sims.",2,0,1,"February 16, 2021"

Overall, the game is moderately okay, but the producer slams that down to a poor rating with their draconian oversight. I spend $6 on the game on a 90% discount and I immediately regretted it. For more detail, they ask you personal questions that define your character that are just dumb. For instance, it's things like ""what kind of person are you at a party?"" A) the type to do karaoke B) the type to be the center of attention or C) the type to pull pranks. Those are the three choices, and you cannot change your character's personality after answering this. THEY ARE THE SAME ANSWER. It's extremely difficult to modify any item within the household, which is vaingloriously produced as a ""Starter house"" even though it is clearly an incredibly expensive property. EA refused my password because they said it was inappropriate, which is just asinine as it was not. They forced me to create an additional account instead of letting me play from Steam. To be clear, I paid for the game on Steam but EA demanded I register it with them, for some reason. It's just typical EA business, nothing new. If you are willing to fight through EA nonsense to play a mostly subpar game, it might be worth it. For me, at 90% discount, I don't think it is worth it. I pay $6 for this game and I feel that is extraordinarily generous. As far as customization, this is a massive downgrade from Sims III. This game requires you to wear certain outfits that conform with their decisions of what is appropriate. For instance, you cannot wear socks when it is hot. You can wear a sweater while exercising, however there are only a few colors that are deemed appropriate. You cannot wear jeans to sleep, during hot weather, for formal wear, etc. The vast, vast majority of clothing options have less than five color choices. You cannot choose the color yourself. Honestly it's not surprising, EA probably charges extra for color packs as opposed to you choosing the color yourself. You want to wear jeans? You can wear black jeans, light blue jeans, or dark blue jeans. Any other options are locked behind a paywall. If you choose to skip the tutorial, the game refuses your request and immediately forces you into a tutorial. Again, this is typical EA and should be expected. It's not a bad game, but EA sets such a low bar of standards than anything you might want to do is restricted by paywalls. Even then, things as common as snapbacks are portrayed as a weird furry-Brookyln style hybrid. Honestly, it would be one thing if they restricted color. Another if they restricted content. Another if they produced content poorly. But EA restricts each of these things and, as insult to injury, doesn't even make the content look remotely passable. Not a terrible game, but not great, and EA's famous paywalls make it that much poorer.",2,0,-1,"December 29, 2020"

76561199076666072,Tacocat393,Sims is a Good game but there is only so much you can do without buying one of the DLC's or downloading a mod for the game. But you can still have a lot of fun with all that is available in the base game. I really enjoyed that sims is still fun for me even to this day. I played for a couple of hours the first time I played it 7/10 game.,2,0,1,"December 26, 2020"

AstraPixi,AstraPixi,"Very glad the game is free now, even though I paid full price for the special edition back in 2014. Been playing all of The Sims series since the first release of The Sims in 2000, and it's been nothing more than silly fun. The Sims has changed tremendously for the good and the bad, but at the end of the day, it's still The Sims. I am going into adulthood now and barely have time to enjoy it as I would like to. My younger sister, who is 14 (at the moment of this review), also loves The Sims and now has the opportunity to play the collection I've purchased throughout the years without spending a dime (or yen) when I'm sharing my account with her; I agree that the prices of the add-ons are a bit ridiculous. I recommend The Sims only if you've been with it for a while or would like more out of The Sims besides it being free. The expansions are pricey, but it's been like that since the beginning of the franchise. If that's an issue, then I would recommend you look elsewhere.",2,0,1,"November 26, 2020"
76561198090203949,Duncan Rac,"The sequel to my most favored game (The Sims 3), The Sims 4 does not hold the same energy and steaks that the third title brought and introduced into the series, though, at the same time, it was a risky move either way. The Sims 4 returned to the limited world scope instead of being a singular town map that transitioned more smoother and did not rely on loading screens. However, the screen loads are much quicker than in The Sims 2. There are also fewer traits available to select, with around four at the max and almost 6 in its previous title if you have the University Life DLC. Initially, the game had no toddlers and not much content available at launch (even less offered than its predecessor). Death was not too hard to find or accomplish with any action attempted resulting it, but now it is less so luckily since the title came to Steam this year. With each new announced DLC, it has brought in more options and helps strengthen the title from its basic and its lack of content in the base game. The modding community has also helped add more layers to the game, such as going to school, hairstyles, maps, and even occupations such as resort owning, just like in The Sims 3's DLC Island Paradise. With fresh eyes on The Sims 4, it has differently improved from its launch and was much more entertaining the second go around. However, it still does not top what The Sims 3 brought to the table for me. 9.4/10 :D",2,0,1,"November 26, 2020"
MadManess,!MAD!MAN!,The Sims is just a cute game where you stress out about all of your sims dying due to them not wanting to use a perfectly fine toilet. I can only stress when playing this game. 9/10 good stress simulator,2,0,1,"November 26, 2020"
